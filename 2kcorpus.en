resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday , 28 march 1996 .
welcome
i bid you a warm welcome !
approval of the minutes
the minutes of the sitting of thursday , 28 march 1996 have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
points 16 and 17 now contradict one another whereas the voting showed otherwise .
i shall be passing on to you some comments which you could perhaps take up with regard to the voting .
i will have to look into that , mrs oomen-ruijten .
i cannot say anything at this stage .
we will consider the matter .
mr president , it concerns the speech made last week by mr fischler on bse and reported in the minutes .
perhaps the commission or you could clarify a point for me .
it would appear that a speech made at the weekend by mr fischler indicates a change of his position .
i welcome this change because he has said that he will eat british beef and that the ban was imposed specifically for economic and political reasons .
could somebody clarify that he has actually said this please , mr president , because it is a change of views .
mr sturdy , i cannot see what that has to do with the minutes .
mr president , on exactly the same point as mr sturdy has raised .
if commission fischler has made this statement , then he has said that it is not a matter of public health .
mr smith , the same applies to your point ; it has nothing to do with the minutes .
mr president , again on bse .
if mr fischler has changed his views does this mean the commission has ?
this was actually referred to in the minutes .
he said that any funding would also go towards supporting workers who had directly lost their jobs .
so far nothing has come of this in any scheme that has been put forward .
does this mean the commission has changed its view on supporting workers who have lost their jobs through this scare ?
i note that there are no comments on the minutes .
( parliament approved the minutes )
now that is clearly a fraud on the french taxpayer as well as a fraud on the european citizens .
can we ask the bureau to look into this fact .
can we ask you as president to make sure that is happening with the taxpayers ' money for which we are collectively responsible .
mr tomlinson , would you please give me the documents concerned .
then i will look into the matter , both in the presidency and with the other organizations in question .
you yourself know best how difficult and complicated the legal situation is between parliament and the firms contracted to build the hemicycle .
after all , we have in you an expert who is in any case closely concerned with these matters .
mr president , i should like to deal very briefly with two matters .
thank you !
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 11 april 1996 pursuant to rule 95 of the rules of procedure has been distributed .
no amendments have been proposed .
mr president , i should like to ask a question .
we were too late to hand it in , but it has been discussed with a number of members . it is the following .
i think that in view of present events in the middle east , we ought to ask whether the council can make a statement on wednesday afternoon about the way things are going .
we note that the situation is changing every day . we see that the french government has sent a mediator .
we hear nothing from the presidency . nor have we heard anything , unfortunately , from the commission .
that is reason enough for us to be put in the picture .
i should like to ask you to see whether it is possible for the italian presidency to do that on wednesday afternoon .
we recognize that the agenda is very full .
then we could deal with chernobyl some time later .
i offer that as a suggestion , mr president .
if you would like to arrange things some other way so that we do not need to take chernobyl off the agenda that would suit us just as well .
mr president , my group is certainly of the view that what is happening in the middle east is very significant and that we cannot let this week with parliament in full session pass without any response or discussion .
could we leave it to you , mr president , to see whether the council is prepared to make a statement on the middle east and what is happening in the lebanon ?
could we then look to you to see what is possible .
i am reluctant , as i know many of my colleagues are , to remove chernobyl from the agenda , as suggested by mrs oomen-ruijten .
however , it would be possible for us to come back to the issue of chernobyl which does not have such immediacy although it is the tenth anniversary .
we could take this in two weeks ' time , whereas the issue of lebanon is crucial at this moment .
perhaps , mr president , we could ask you to look at this with the council and see what would be possible .
mr president , i am glad to support mrs oomen-ruijten 's suggestion , supported by mrs green - with one slight reservation .
that is no problem for me ; i think it is a good initiative , but again europe is absent .
that was previously the case in the crisis between turkey and greece , and then mr holbrooke rightly said :
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i think it is important that we should discuss the situation in the middle east this week .
we all agree on that .
but i think it is equally important that we discuss chernobyl this week .
i cannot support this proposal .
the whole world is talking about the tenth anniversary .
a major conference was held in vienna .
there was a tribunal .
and then we say we will postpone it to whenever .
i really think it would show parliament in a poor light if we do not discuss it on wednesday .
there are various other options .
we can listen to the council on the subject on wednesday morning , but please not just in a week 's time .
at a time when the whole world is discussing chernobyl and the effects of that disaster , we in this parliament cannot say , we shall hold back and say nothing about it !
mr president , i have already given you the reasons why the council should make a statement about the bombardment of lebanon .
that would be a bad sign for the intergovernmental conference and for the future of the european union .
but i think , like mrs roth , that we cannot make the subject of chernobyl and the subject of the middle east compete in the ' free market for news items ' .
we must seek out the opportunity to discuss both subjects .
mr president , like previous colleagues , i believe it to be absolutely essential that the council make a statement on wednesday about the middle east situation , particularly in southern lebanon .
what is happening there is worrying and distressing because the whole peace process that has been under way for several months could be threatened .
we should also remember lebanon itself , which has been ravaged for many years , under the domination of one foreign power while part of its territory is occupied by another .
ladies and gentlemen , this is one of the cases where there is no satisfactory solution because someone is bound to be disappointed and any decision is bound to be to the detriment of someone 's interests .
let me describe the situation to you as i see it .
first , let me please establish whether the council is prepared and in a position to make a statement .
but it would be neither right nor a good idea to shorten that debate since the italian president-in-office of the council will be here on wednesday morning .
so the only possible compromise is to postpone the gonz&aacute;les &aacute;lvarez report and cut question time by half an hour .
i realise that to do so would be at the cost of members who have questions .
that is regrettable .
it is not that we will satisfy everybody this way , but if we are to try to find a solution , i am convinced that is the only possible one .
the order of business for this week is thus established .
energy efficiency
overall , this proposal is very vague and general and , sadly , contains no real topics or projects .
the legislative level has been disregarded entirely , although the evaluation of save i showed that 80 % of the successes of that programme were achieved by means of legislative measures .
many of the proposals for directives and action programmes planned by the commission have for some obscure reason never seen the light of day .
for instance , it has been estimated that the introduction of calorimeters would have yielded savings of approximately 4.75 million tonnes of crude oil units and a co2 reduction by the year 2010 of 12 million tonnes per year .
the savings from the introduction of an energy certificate for buildings would have been far higher than that even .
this list could be extended forever .
it is clear that whenever the practical will is not there , subsidiarity is brought up as an argument .
that is why the responsibility for achieving the efficiency target and at the same time reducing co2 lies with the community , which in fact takes action when an objective can be achieved more effectively by community measures .
strictly speaking , it is the credibility of the eu that is at stake here .
the commission and the council have constantly declared how vital it is to reduce co2 and to save energy .
the council has set objectives in a series of resolutions , for example in its resolutions of 16.9.86 and 29.10.90 and in the commitments it made in rio and berlin .
so far , however , there has been no more than grandiloquent announcements and reams of paper .
the commission itself estimates that the co2 emissions will rise by up to 8 % in the period from 1995 to 2000 .
so one may well ask : is the community actually taking its own practical declarations of intent and obligations towards its citizens , and towards the international community , seriously or is this just a theatre of the absurd ?
if it really is being serious , words must finally be followed by deeds .
we urgently need genuine measures to combat the greenhouse effect and increase energy efficiency .
the situation is too serious to allow for any further delay .
a beginning might be made with a genuinely ambitious save ii programme , as proposed by the committee on research , technological development and energy .
that is why the amendments tabled by that committee should quite definitely be adopted .
the objection that such programmes can only be disruptive given the current economic climate and unemployment level in many member states is unacceptable and merely ridiculous .
for in addition to their environmental dimension , they can also have a substantial positive impact on the economy .
according to the commission , apart from its effects on the quality of life , these savings would also have positive effects on employment .
let me repeat that i deeply regret that the committee did not accept my proposal that we extricate ourselves from this unholy cooperation procedure and aim at a co-decision procedure .
it would have been more sensible for parliament always to apply the co-decision procedure .
if we give the money we should also be able to say that we would like to see legislative measures .
for that is the decisive point here .
mr president , firstly i congratulate mrs bloch von blottnitz on the amazing feat of achieving consensus in the committee on research . technological development and energy .
i think she is well placed through her excellent report to achieve consensus in the plenary session of parliament .
energy efficiency is of fundamental importance both to the environmental and the competitiveness policies of the european union .
as far as the environment is concerned , we are a long way off meeting the targets which we set ourselves in rio .
we are suffering widespread climate instability because of that failure .
as far as competitiveness is concerned , we see a reprehensible and incredible waste of money throughout the european union ; billions and billions of ecus are being wasted in energy usage that is not necessary .
think of the purchasing power which those billions could release to our economy .
larger firms are , of course , aware of this .
our target through this programme has to be the smaller firms and individual households .
they must make the decisions which will allow us to save that energy and save that money .
if we look at the history we see very rapid action following the oil shock in 1973 .
since then , however , there has been major regression tempered only by the recession which has hit most of our countries .
the energy / intensity use in most of the european union is worsening .
that is unacceptable .
the save i programme was very small beer , a very small amount of money .
it is being evaluated , fortunately , before we move on to save ii .
one would have hoped the lessons from save i would be learnt .
that is not so , as i shall explain later on .
one of the lessons from save i was that far and away the best thing to do is to bring in binding legislation which member states have to enforce .
there were ambitious plans for legislation .
very little of that legislation has appeared .
it is true that we have legislation on the efficiency of boilers , fridges and freezers , labelling , and there is more to come .
but that is not enough .
we know that the main obstacle has been the predictable resistance of manufacturers .
they have no vested interest in energy efficiency and that is clear from their stance .
let us look at the lessons .
firstly , legislation is what works .
secondly , you must have targets and you must monitor them .
the target in save ii is not ambitious ; 1.5 % increase year-on-year is not ambitious .
i would like to see an indicative programme issued by the commission and monitored throughout the member states .
another lesson that is important , not from save i but from the regional programme , is that you must incorporate measures on energy efficiency into the regional work of the eu and its policies .
they help impoverished regions .
of course the same would apply to third countries .
i would like to see far more emphasis in our dealings with countries in central and eastern europe and the mediterranean areas on energy efficiency .
one area which must be emphasized above all is transport .
transport takes almost half the energy cost and it uses almost half the oil .
we have not done enough in that sector .
then there are domestic and industrial appliances , insulation for the heating of homes , and in some parts of the eu for the cooling of homes .
there is a good home rating scheme developed in my own constituency which should be far more widespread .
it must be made easier for third parties to finance energy-efficient measures and for the growing industry of energy services to be helped . this makes us competitive , remember .
combined heat and power is another very sensible measure which needs encouragement ; as do education and information throughout the eu , particularly to the target groups .
we need millions of people to make decisions which do not seem obvious to them .
employment would be greatly helped by an extension of energy efficiency .
this has been proved in study after study .
i am therefore deeply disappointed at the negative attitude of the council of ministers which cannot even be bothered to get a proper legal base for the save ii programme .
that is indeed reprehensible , given the urgency .
i think we will see this week a very clear expression of the will of the european parliament representing people in every member state .
that will is to say : ' let us have much stronger measures for energy efficiency ' .
save ii is nowhere near ambitious enough .
it has not learned all the lessons from save i. it is a very limited , minimal approach but it is absolutely essential that the council of ministers knows that the european parliament is backing it very strongly indeed .
mr president , on behalf of the european people 's party i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , both on the content of her report and on the consensus that she fostered in the committee .
that consensus has led to a number of common conclusions which i will not spell out in detail now .
however , it is worth pointing out once again that with this programme we are seeking to promote environmental improvement and to increase the competitiveness of europe 's undertakings .
the commission 's proposal to treble the resources for the save ii programme , as compared with the save i programme , is certainly encouraging .
save ii seems to be pointed towards the second of those two paths . however , it would perhaps be better if the funding could be allocated as evenly as possible over the whole duration of the programme .
save ii endeavours to strengthening pilot actions that were undertaken in the first programme and also makes provision for new actions .
as has already been said , the programme ignores the positive results that have stemmed from legislative measures and the possibility of achieving a further increase in energy efficiency via the same route .
although i do not believe that legislation would help us down that route , i feel that we should not disregard the experience that we have gained from the past at a very heavy price .
i would therefore advise the commission to look for a middle way , so as to provide an impetus to small and medium-sized enterprises in particular , as i said before .
however , it would also be useful if the commission were to take account of the need to achieve convergence between the member states in the area of energy efficiency .
mr president , i support mrs bloch von blottnitz 's report .
she introduced it with her usual efficiency .
it is important that we support the continuation of the save energy efficiency programme with a budget of ecu 120m for the period from 1996 to 2000 .
the save initiative , which dates back to 1991 , is one of the cornerstones for the european union policies to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 .
the renewal of the save programme may be timely as the european commission reports that the carbon dioxide target is being exceeded by 5 % .
indeed , according to estimates , carbon dioxide accounts for 50 % of the greenhouse gases now present in the atmosphere .
between 1991 and 1994 the save programme funded a total of 203 pilot projects in the energy efficiency field .
in ireland alone we undertook 12 pilot projects with the assistance of save funds .
so i fully agree with the objective to improve energy efficiency by a further 1.5 % per annum within the european union .
it is important in this context that the save initiatives should be coordinated with other european union energy initiatives such as thermie and synergy .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am pleased first of all to compliment the rapporteur on the excellent report on save ii .
this report makes a contribution to the difficult but important battle for a sustainable environment and a sustainable development of our economy .
for the group of the european liberal , democratic and reformist party sustainable development means a situation in which the natural raw materials are so used that future generations can also make use of them in the same way .
liberals start with their own responsibility and do not shuffle it off on to succeeding generations .
that of course means that there must be sustainable management of natural resources . there is a price-tag on pollution .
so the environmental costs of consumption and production must be made visible in the economy .
the committee on energy has approved 35 amendments , four of them from the group of the european liberal , democratic and reformist party .
i should like to explain two of them .
a shift , ladies and gentlemen , in the use of energy sources , in particular in the direction of renewable energy sources , could make these figures considerably more attractive .
that should be encouraged in the framework of save ii .
it is essential to apply modern energy technologies and to switch to cleaner industries in eastern europe .
that is good for the environment and good for the economy and benefits both the union and third countries .
that is what makes this collaboration so significant .
mr president , it is certainly appropriate that at least one representative of a nordic state should take part in this debate on the programme for the promotion of energy efficiency .
there is quite a lot of snow too .
in the north , particularly in a country dominated by the paper industry , industrial users of course consume an enormous amount of energy , but we also use a lot of energy in heating .
this winter has been particularly cold , and this has meant that considerably more energy has been used than normal .
of course , we cannot do anything about the forces of nature .
we can , however , do a lot to improve energy efficiency . in finland , for example , there are currently enormous quantities of wood , of waste wood , which nobody uses .
and in order to make use of these forms of energy , we need money for research ; there is also plenty of room for improvement as regards all the existing forms of energy .
the directive on refrigerators , which the next speaker mr macartney has reported on , may even now be being debated in the council .
indeed , parliament has only just debated this directive , and it must be said that in many developed countries the objectives set out there do not represent anything new .
we need to set more ambitious objectives and ensure that the old , wasteful sources of energy are modernized .
the save programme is of great importance in all this improvement of energy efficiency , but in itself it does not help as much as it could .
i hope that this save ii programme will be adopted but there is much that could be done to improve it .
i have to say that it is a bit like motherhood .
everyone supports energy savings , everyone is in favour of motherhood .
but where are the real supports .
the commission has failed with these proposals to give us real support , key legislative proposals .
parliament has stepped in and , correctly , pointed this out .
we do not have very much time left before the year 2000 to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves .
let us have some real legislative proposals this time around .
the most important thing we have done recently is to evaluate the save programme .
we have done an excellent evaluation and have come up with the real result that you need legislative proposals .
we need teeth to make the save proposals sink in .
unless we get teeth the member states will not do the work . we will not get the results we need .
we have to harmonize with other programmes .
we have to harmonize with thermie and synergy and we have to export these ideas to third countries , particularly the east .
but let us show an example ourselves .
where are the save programmes for the european parliament ?
where are the energy saving programmes for the commission ?
let us do some real work ourselves on our own buildings .
buildings are shooting up here and in brussels .
where are the real energy saving proposals there ?
we pontificate about what third countries and peripheral states should do all the time .
let us do something real here in the heart of europe where we have money .
let us do it legislatively and with fiscal instruments .
i do not accept that we cannot use fiscal instruments .
it is about time we got back to using them .
mr president , i wish to respond to the point made by mrs stenius-kaukonen that those of us who live in the more northerly parts of europe suffer from colder winters !
it is something which is fairly obvious when you state it but clearly it has profound implications for the people who live in those climates .
a lot of lessons could be learned by our people and these could be applied right across europe to everybody 's benefit .
later on in this parliament we shall be returning again to the subject of domestic freezers and fridges , which is a subject that often causes eyes to glaze over , i have to admit .
but when people realize how much energy the fridge or the freezer in their house consumes all the year round , i think they will realize this is important .
mr president , almost three years ago today i stood in this spot and delivered the opinion of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection on the save i programme .
save i , which parliament criticized for having insufficient finance and ambition , detailed 13 legal actions and standards that would be undertaken .
in practice , only four directives emerged and it is unacceptable that the present proposal makes no reference to the failure of save i as a legislative programme .
for instance , we still have no directive on energy efficiency of buildings .
at the time of rio there was great excitement .
we believed in those targets . this programme does not go far enough to meet those targets .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur , mrs bloch von blottnitz , for her very important report , and also the draftsmen of the opinions of the parliamentary committees .
the save i programme which ended in 1995 was initially devised as an energy efficiency programme . however , as it progressed it became the cornerstone of the european union 's strategy for reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
however , we have also been guided by another factor , namely the lack of progress on the question of an energy tax .
and it is precisely that which has led us into developing save ii as a wider and fuller initiative .
mr president , commissioner , i would like you to tell me when you will be presenting the legislative proposals . you said it would be very soon .
we are calling for legislative proposals and you say they have already been implemented . surely that is not the case .
the directive merely refers to the measures , while it is left open to the member states whether they implement them or not . but they have not done so .
that is precisely what we need in save ii . after all , it is useless simply to leave the implementation of such measures to the member states .
it is true that the forecasts and estimates for the next 200 years provide grounds for claiming that energy reserves are plentiful , but they are for the most part located outside the european union .
and the energy dependency of the european union , already of the order of 48 % , could reach 70 % by the year 2020 .
maintaining the security of eu countries , and world stability and peace , require clear-headedness , a vigorous approach and a search for worldwide energy cooperation .
mr soulier has provided some figures which indicate how the general energy picture is likely to evolve in the immediate future .
i will not repeat them , but i do agree .
in the light of those figures the synergy programme assumes particularly great importance because in focusing on third countries and providing them with assistance it will help those countries formulate and implement energy policies of their own .
mr president , let me by way of introduction remind you again of the position of the committee on budgets , namely that no important measures should be financed from the general budget without an appropriate legal base .
this differentiated breakdown shows that the synergy programme gives a greater financial contribution to the administrative costs than to the operational projects .
the companies certainly benefit from the energy charter and certainly have the financial resources to finance the secretariat .
for that reason , the citizens of the eu cannot be asked to continue paying for this .
the committee on budgets already pointed out when the treaty was signed that it must not imply any significant budgetary burden on the eu , and that , we believe , is how it should remain .
we need a change of energy policy .
let me briefly raise three aspects . firstly , the 25 billion tonnes of co2 emissions we puff into the air every year damage our climate and destroy our natural environment .
secondly , the potential of nuclear energy is limited .
we already have some 120 000 tonnes of radioactive waste and nobody knows what is to be done with it .
thirdly , of course there is a growing energy demand because everyone on this earth has a right to quality of life .
that is why the commission 's proposal to develop a strategy of cross-frontier cooperation is most welcome .
however , a programme of this kind , which after all accounts for ecu 50 million , must also satisfy certain requirements .
co2 emissions are a cross-border problem and require a european approach .
the eco-tax is an excellent means for that .
the netherlands are at present the only member state to have energy taxation , but co2 emissions are not only a european but a world-wide problem .
i should also like to say , along with another colleague , that nuclear safety does not belong in such a programme . we have other programmes devoted to nuclear safety .
there are great problems in trying to export nuclear technology to developing countries . for example , we have not solved the problems of waste .
finally , concerning the rational use of energy and sustainable development , we need to be developing them through fiscal instruments in particular .
i agree with a global approach on this level . we should follow the rio agenda .
the co-ordination of energy policies in relation with third countries is a priority and should not just be seen as an appendix but as part and parcel of any future european energy policy .
i hope that the recent proposal by the portuguese foreign minister to hold regular euro-african summits can open up opportunities in this area .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i should like to thank mr soulier for his marvellous report .
mr president , if i have understood correctly , the ministers for transport have recently been doing some soulsearching about the future of goods transport by rail . it is about time too .
the directive on the interoperability of the trans-european high- speed rail system and its history and content still do not bring that dawn .
seven years have gone by between the initiative and this second reading .
what is the result of all that ? movement backwards , which the often strained relations between the national authorities and the rail companies seem to confirm .
' with the amendments made by the council to the proposal for a directive the aims sought by the commission in its original proposals have been drastically altered .
that is the end of the quotation , with my apologies for the involved wording .
that quotation is the commission 's conclusion which above all stresses once more the wish to take account of users ' needs and expresses regret at the council 's attitude .
the second reading must make it clear to the council once more by the proposals for amendment the essence of what is involved in the matters we are discussing together today .
europe 's rail systems must be compatible .
they must work together . they must share the same technical standards .
they must do that if europe 's railways are to fulfil their potential to shift passengers and freight from our congested roads and airspace so that we meet our environmental objectives .
secondly , we must realize our potential to become more competitive as europeans and to foster growth and employment .
however , we can only build europe 's railways for the 21st century if we standardize our national railway systems that were created in the 19th century . it will cost money .
this evening i wish to focus on the need for passengers to have easy access to the whole of the european high-speed network . that includes passengers with disabilities .
a case in point is the marvellous , high-tech , high-speed eurostar train which now serves my constituency and links london to brussels and paris . marvellous , unless you are a disabled passenger .
it applies too to the high-speed lines . furthermore it is just as important for the systems to be interoperable also in the sense that they become more attractive for the user .
mr president , i am speaking on behalf of mr van der waal , who cannot he here because he is ill .
the commission 's proposal on interoperability of the european network for highspeed trains has been drastically altered by the council .
instead of striving for a european network of high-speed trains the accent is now placed more on preservation of the existing national high-speed networks , which have been made interoperable only where necessary or where desired .
adaptation of existing or planned infrastructure costs a lot of money - money which , incidentally , is not available , amongst other things because of the emu criteria .
with hindsight it is very much to be regretted that european standards were not in force before the construction of the national high-speed networks .
those difficulties are apparent if we bear in mind that certain factors - environment , users and management - vary from one country to another .
that is why the council moved away from the original commission proposal and , in some respects , parliament 's amendments .
it is therefore desirable that interoperability be gradually achieved in relation to transfrontier traffic , the rapid transport of goods and , at a later and none-toodistant stage - the whole of rail transport .
here there is an implied attitude which is debatable from the point of view of a broad vision of the process of developing the networks and providing services .
to be specific , from a reading of the provisions of this proposal for a directive the lack of interoperability emerges as a fundamental problem as it creates internal frontiers which hinder freedom of movement .
the interoperability of the networks is therefore a question to be solved first. previously .
once the problem has been expressed in those terms it must be recognized that as long as there is no interoperability there will be no freedom of movement .
but a statement like that is in itself little more than tautology .
the cumulative deficit of the sncf , which is supported by the state , that is the taxpayer , is ff 175 billion .
the commission cannot , however , support the amendment from mr soulier - amendment no 12 - because it would complicate the interoperability framework which we are establishing , and that contradicts the efforts to achieve simplification .
so we are happy to collaborate in the introduction of a uniform system for transport of dangerous materials for the whole territory of the european union .
such a uniform system must guarantee an acceptable level of safety and eliminate existing obstructions to free movement of goods between the member states in the field of means of transport .
the second point concerns informing the competent authorities in advance where transport of extremely dangerous goods is concerned .
the railway accident in flanders on thursday last week made it clear once again that in spite of good safety standards accidents can never be ruled out .
that applies also to transport of extremely dangerous goods .
we think that in the event of an unexpected accident involving particularly dangerous transport operations it is important for the competent authorities to be informed about the operations .
i appreciate that it is not easy to lay down practicable criteria for the concept of ' extremely dangerous goods ' . for that i shall rely on the creativity of directorate general vii .
it is also proposed to transpose into community law the rules contained in the rid regulations as they are applied to international rail transport to include operations within member states . these moves are strongly supported by my group .
while we as a group can support the position adopted by the rapporteur and the committee on transport and tourism , we have some reservations about the number of derogations introduced by the council , particularly in article 5 .
we believe this could have the effect of putting rail at a disadvantage compared to other modes of transportation .
the aims are clearly to achieve the highest level of safety and to establish a single market for these transport services within europe .
for instance , it has been made compulsory for the member states to notify the competent authorities so that they can alert the emergency services throughout the territory to be crossed .
the proposal is intended to remove existing obstacles to free movement of goods between member states . having the same regime for all transport of dangerous goods obviously adds transparency and clarity for the user and ensures greater safety .
clearly , the commission recognises that existing national regimes for the transport of dangerous goods have developed separately and diversely . we naturally appreciate that harmonization cannot be achieved overnight .
the council increased the flexibility provided for in our original proposal .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his answer , although he must understand that i do not agree with him in all respects .
but i would ask him to be rather more specific in answering my question about how the commission will manage with the concept of ' tunnels with characteristics similar to the channel tunnel ' .
by their very nature these tunnels are huge pieces of infrastructural development . by their very nature they must be secure for the purpose of the transport of dangerous goods .
decision on urgency
madam president , the committee on fisheries has agreed to accept urgent procedure and to ask for this to be placed on the agenda for the procedure without debate .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
the report will therefore be put to the vote on friday morning .
the deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on wednesday .
madam president , the committee on external economic relations yesterday unanimously adopted the request for urgency on the report by mr pex , as you rightly said .
we hope that the house will do the same .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
this item is also placed on the agenda for friday .
the deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on wednesday .
the aim of the programme is to assimilate and increase the efficiency of customs procedures and customs administration .
many of the working methods and organizational structures used by the national customs services vary widely and urgently need to be brought more closely into line with each other .
at first reading we adopted a number of amendments to the programme , many of which the commission has incorporated in its amended proposal .
the council , however , has made it clear in its unanimously adopted common position that it has different priorities from those of parliament .
we had a detailed discussion with the commission and the council in the committee on whether or not we have community customs .
the recommendation before you at second reading lays emphasis on the further development of the european internal market into a proper european home market with open internal borders and a common external border .
particular attention is to be paid to the associated countries of central and eastern europe .
as a first step towards an eventual common customs administration , customs officials are to wear the twelve-star symbol of the community to make it clear that they belong to a common service .
in my opinion , this last point is particularly important and could be especially useful in protecting the community 's financial interests .
the people who will be most affected by this development are freight carriers , who are liable to the customs administration for the proper execution of the transport procedures .
there are huge sums of money involved here , and the carriers are required to provide the customs office with security for their liability .
cases of fraudulent evasion of customs duties which are discovered by the customs authorities result in enormous penalties for the carriers .
in the netherlands alone , carriers have had to pay almost ecu 900 million , the situation in germany being almost as bad .
for europe as a whole , the figure is estimated at around ecu 3 billion , and it is often only fairly small-scale firms which are involved .
individual firms have faced demands for more than dm 50 million , for example , and for many this can spell financial ruin .
in calling for the customs services to be fully computerized as quickly as possible , parliament therefore hopes to help prevent fraud and protect jobs .
in the field of legislation too , efforts are being made to achieve harmonization between member states , and there must also be a certain homogeneity between them in the way they interpret this legislation .
but i should like to place particular emphasis , as most members of the committee sought to do , on the fight against all forms of fraud , and fraud arising out of transit operations in particular .
we stress that sufficient funds should be made available under this programme to enable the declarations of intent to be expressed in action in the field .
such are the conclusions of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy and at this point i should like to thank our rapporteur and chairman mr von wogau .
i repeat , if we want to be credible we must combat all the many forms of fraud which abound within the union and which prompt nationalist reactions .
madam president , a single market needs common protection .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should first of all like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of my group for the great commitment he has shown over a number of weeks while working on this recommendation .
the community has uniform customs legislation and should therefore ensure that customs controls are applied equally strictly everywhere .
i think the programme you have proposed will be helpful here , but you will also have to monitor it in practice .
i therefore welcome the fact that the commission has said it is prepared to try to help importers and exporters by considering ways to simplify procedures .
i think that this form of partnership between economic operators and customs authorities is a very good idea and should definitely be followed up .
madam president , the issue we are again discussing today - in the hope of being able to arrive at a definition of it - is of the greatest importance for the european internal market .
it is very important to define the powers of customs officers , and these have , of necessity to be uniform throughout the union .
we firmly believe that this proposal may represent a vital step towards the completion of the internal market .
madam president , the customs 2000 programme is very important and it is still more important to launch it with realistic objectives .
in this respect parliament is perhaps attempting to achieve rather overambitious objectives too quickly .
for a long time to come we will be aiming rather at speedier cooperation between customs systems than at a separate common customs system - not least because there are still very sensitive issues associated with the external borders .
the greens wish to stress the importance of customs cooperation with third countries and the european union 's immediate neighbours .
in our opinion at least one-fifth of the customs 2000 funds should be used to develop those countries ' customs institutions and cooperation with them .
madam president , both the proposed programme and mr von wogau 's report are something of a curate 's egg .
one last point .
the planned accession of the countries of central and eastern europe will mean extra work for the european union , and we should start now to prepare the ground for future cooperation with the customs services of these countries .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , mr jarzembowski welcomed the fact that the programme specifically includes economic operators .
but if only we had included them in the past and heeded their warnings , we would not now be planning to extend the t1 system to cover the visegrad states .
to put it bluntly , there is no point in having talks with economic operators or with the customs authorities if we do not draw the appropriate conclusions .
if all that happens at the end of the day is that a political decision is taken which cannot be justified in practical terms , then even the most constructive talks are useless .
nevertheless , we would of course welcome the continuation of talks as part of this programme .
i have a comment to make about amendment no 16 , which has caused some misunderstanding because it calls for direct customs control to have priority over every other method .
this does not mean , of course , that every lorry has to be unloaded at the border or its destination , which would , as we all know , be quite stupid .
the aim is not to find a scapegoat and hold them responsible for as long as possible .
the aim must be to take deterrent and preventive action , and this is only possible with controls .
noone was in any doubt about that .
and there is no doubt that the romantic symbol of gold stars on the customs officers ' new uniform is going to do anything to solve this problem ...
the measures which must be taken are well and truly enshrined in articles 7 and 8 .
will those measures be taken ?
will there be really any interest among the member states to take these measures ?
will not many top officials in various member states be interested in making sure that there is a certain freedom in terms of fraud so that competition takes place and their products can be sold ?
to what extent can member states be made responsible for ensuring that provision already taken should actually be executed ?
otherwise the whole of this can have no effect and the customs 2000 programme will just be another document worked out by the commission and the council of ministers .
madam president , i have only a few brief comments to make on a report whose conclusions i largely support .
this means that the individual member states should undertake to achieve at least a certain standard of control but that they will be at complete liberty to introduce a stricter system of checks if they so wish .
in the debate in the committee on economic affairs mr von wogau also confirmed that the criteria would be of this minimum nature .
i should like to point out that there is considerable concern in my country that the single market may make it more difficult for us to carry out effective customs to prevent the importation of drugs .
an overwhelming majority of the population want us to be able to step up inspections if we so wish .
for this reason i am also critical of the formulations in amendment no 3 .
finally , madam president , i have my doubts about the value of customs officials ' uniforms bearing the eu logo with the twelve stars .
i therefore regard the twelve stars as a worthless symbol .
i admit , however , that this issue is completely insignificant and it does not affect my positive attitude to mr von wogau 's report .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur , mr von wogau , for the important work he has done .
as stated in the report , the vital precondition for creating a genuine internal market is that there has to be joint protection of external frontiers .
bearing in mind those fundamental objectives , the commission put forward this text on 6 april 1995 , and it was first considered by the house on 25 october last .
of the 34 amendments you then tabled , 23 were taken up by the commission in its amended proposal of 21 november , and 14 adopted by the council in the common position of 22 december 1995 .
similarly , this decision does not of itself represent the main instrument devised by the commission to tackle serious but specific problems it has identified in relation to fraud , particularly as regards transit .
those issues will be specifically dealt with , in separate proposals , in a different context .
nonetheless , the ' customs 2000 ' programme will provide a framework particularly suited to developing a genuine policy of prevention to combat customs fraud .
and it is in the light of those objectives that the commission has weighed up the amendments tabled in your draft decision on second reading .
the house proposes incorporating 23 amendments into the common position of the council - on which the commission gave its view on 11 january .
that being so , the commission undertakes to include those issues in the work that will be done in implementing this programme .
to conclude , the commission welcomes the great interest that the ' customs 2000 ' programme has generated in the house and the active support our proposal has been given .
thank you , mr monti .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
industrial policy for the pharmaceutical sector
ladies and gentlemen , this report is sure to provoke very widely differing views on the industrial policy we should pursue in the pharmaceutical sector .
i should like to pick up on this point .
mr bangemann , we were at the emea conference in london together , and i assume that you , as a forward-thinking consumer protector , will also support these demands .
i would like to stress that certain passages in this report have been watered down as a compromise , to ensure that it would receive a majority .
this is , of course , not the ideal way to produce a report , but in the end the wording is always some sort of compromise .
we are also calling for a responsible export policy in the pharmaceutical sector , with the introduction of a code of conduct .
let me be quite clear about this . a modern industrial policy must not be geared towards either producers or customers .
it must be geared towards society and its legitimate needs , and above all , mr bangemann , it must have the courage to innovate .
in my view , the report should be adopted as it stands .
i hope that it will be widely supported , and i would be delighted if it helped to give the people of europe confidence in our ability to protect those who are ill .
madam president , i should like to start where the rapporteur has left off .
we have to recognize , however , that the idea of having an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry is rather different from the other industries we have dealt with in the past .
we have to acknowledge that the pharmaceutical industry is intimately linked to health issues and to the national social security systems of our member states .
when we determine an industrial policy - which we should do for the pharmaceutical sector - we have to recognize that it is a much broader sector than the other industries we have looked at in the past .
at a time when governments are trying to cut their budget deficits , we have to look at the costs involved in buying the pharmaceuticals for the health of our nations .
to ensure that we have healthy citizens we have to ensure that drugs are as inexpensive as possible .
the socialist group supports an industrial policy .
we do not believe that we should cherry-pick .
we want to see a comprehensive industrial strategy for the european union and we do not believe we should only look at industries which are in decline .
therefore , we welcome the commission 's proposal to look at the pharmaceutical industry .
there is global competition in this sector .
we recognize that with global markets we have to look at this key industry and ensure that it is competitive within the european union .
that is why the report we have produced looks at a number of key issues .
we want to encourage innovation .
we want adequate protection of new medicinal products .
we want the availability of medicinal products for citizens throughout the european union .
but in addition - and we see no contradiction in this - we want the development of an eu-based generic pharmaceutical industry as a positive contribution to competition .
there is no contradiction if we recognize the importance of the pharmaceutical industry for the health of our citizens and for our national social security systems .
so , we want a well-balanced industrial policy but we want to make sure that this balance recognizes the responsibility that the pharmaceutical industry has in europe .
it has its industrial responsibilities but also a responsibility towards every single citizen that may need to use these products in the future .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission report has been out for two years now , and the house has discussed it in great detail over that period .
it is a good thing that mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer can now tell us that the wording of various passages has been watered down , because the proposals she originally put forward were completely unworkable .
this is not the right way to go about things .
we feel that the commission report paints a relatively accurate picture , but the proposals which it puts forward still need some improvement .
we agree with the socialist group 's analysis here .
the most controversial subject in the committee was the issue of generic medicines , on which there was fierce lobbying from the industry .
this is one area where we can actually achieve something , and i think it would be a good way to promote greater transparency and more competition on the market .
there are a number of factors which they have completely overlooked , however .
first and foremost , there is the importance of medical progress .
research and progress in the pharmaceutical industry depend entirely on having a watertight patent protection period .
secondly , we must not forget that the market for generics is a purely commercial one and involves only products which are commercially successful .
thirdly , the comparison with the situation in the united states does not hold water .
the united states does not have price regulation , so the pharmaceutical industry can recover its research costs more quickly .
the solution lies in free pricing , not in cutting down on the patent protection periods .
the american market is also not fragmented as it is in the union , where the protection period is calculated from the first time a licence is granted in any of the member states .
finally , the innovative pharmaceutical sector is one of the leading generators of employment .
it has a much greater multiplier effect on other sectors and itself employs 530 000 people in europe , 80 000 of them highly skilled .
apart from her desire to reduce the patent protection periods , it is the rapporteur 's views on genetic technology and biotechnology which cause me the greatest anxiety .
i hope that when you vote , ladies and gentlemen , you will put the interests of medical progress and a competitive pharmaceutical industry in europe first .
madam president , in relation to this report it is important to emphasise the special nature of the pharmaceutical industrial sector .
it is umbilically linked to public health and , as point e demonstrates , we should first of all aim at the objective of providing the whole population with safe and efficient medicines .
this undeniable priority comes up at community level against the differences between the health systems and social security regimes in the different member states and various national peculiarities .
on one hand it is a sector which illustrates in the extreme and with many contradictions the process of private transnationalisation leading to the destruction of national industrial sectors .
the case of portugal would be a perfect example of this accelerated and perverse evolution which has made the production and trade in medicines completely dependent on the outside .
it is obvious that the pharmaceuticals industry demands huge resources and calls for extremely burdensome research spending .
however it is very important to prevent that research and development from being exclusively at the service of private interests rather than mankind as a whole or public health .
the delicate nature of these questions and the dimension of the interests at stake are both reflected in the report which should deal less with the market and prices .
but that is how things are .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , what we are doing here is developing a european industrial policy for a particular sector .
in the pharmaceutical sector , we need to reconcile a number of different interests .
first of all , there is our common heritage of biodiversity and acquired scientific knowledge , the latter being a basic prerequisite for the development of pharmaceutical products .
secondly , there are the interests of society , since our social security and healthcare systems are greatly affected by price levels in this sector .
thirdly , there is our common interest in lasting innovation for the future , which means that we will always need industrialists , and they in turn will always need a challenge .
big profits are not enough , otherwise we would have seen a flood of industrial innovation in europe in recent years , which has clearly not been the case .
those who have invested in the sector , however , quite legitimately wish to see a return on their capital .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a commendable report , despite a rather unfortunate title .
is not an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical sector reminiscent of the planning we used to see in the iron curtain countries ?
the argumentation without discussion is cast in the same mould .
while it is admittedly impossible to harmonize the management policies in the pharmaceutical sector , there are certain major subjects of concern which this report fails to address .
a specific approach to this problem is essential due to the appearance of new forms of nonepidemiological illnesses .
a medicine exists because it provides treatment , irrespective of whether it is profitable or not .
japan and the united states have awarded orphan drugs special status .
in europe there is a legal vacuum in this area .
this question of orphan drugs leads us to the whole matter of public health .
europe should endeavour to promote this protection of life at all levels , without excluding the so-called risk groups or the victims of rare diseases .
a healthy notion of public health must allow every individual to obtain treatment according to his real needs .
this communication from the commission seems to be seeking to ascertain how best to restrict the supply of health care .
this is unacceptable .
when you then add to this a failure to understand the market economy , the potion becomes all the more poisonous .
just one additional question : how do people view the merger of ciba-geigy and hoffmann-laroche , which is a result of this report ?
madam president , i wish to record my thanks to the rapporteur for her important work on this key industrial sector in the european union .
we have no real public health strategy for the european union , and this is an important omission , which perhaps we can rectify in other pieces of work .
the rapporteur has rightly drawn attention to some of the problems of the sector and particularly to the way in which companies in the united states of america are in many ways making gains .
the area i wish to concentrate on particularly is responsible self-medication .
there is also an important cost element here and sometimes these two objectives can be in contradiction .
this leads me on to the important role of the pharmacist in the sale and prescription of over-the-counter medicines .
we need effective labelling , effective and comprehensive testing and pharmaceutical advice if patients are to make a genuine , informed choice about over-the-counter prescriptions .
it is difficult to balance the need for adequate regulation and the safeguarding of patients ' rights .
now , perhaps that might be more tenuous were we to look at it in a worldwide context .
i welcome the report .
i welcome the innovation .
i do not agree that we need a pharmaceutical industry with price controls as they are at the moment , but this is an important contribution to a key-sector policy development .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as a practising pharmacist and someone with research experience in the pharmaceutical industry , there are two points that i should like to make .
the most obvious thing that the medical profession does is to advise patients and help them with self-medication .
the transition of medicines from being prescription-only to being available over the counter must be carefully monitored .
only those who have no idea of the huge costs involved in researching new drugs could be in favour of granting earlier licences for generics .
the comparison with the united states , it must be said , simply does not hold water .
as has already been pointed out , patents are protected for 16 years nationwide in the us , whereas in europe , protection only takes effect once the product has been licensed in the various individual countries .
i am not in favour of making generics prescription-only , since i think it is better to leave them to market forces .
madam president , few reports have been the subject of such intensive lobbying by the industry concerned and i think this is always instructive .
the absence of a free market in pharmaceutical products is regrettable .
i suspect that the cost of moving to a free market would be much lower than we imagine but , of course , once the psychology of restricted markets has taken hold it is hard to get over that .
but if we need a free market we also need normal patent procedures .
why cannot we allow , as they do in the united states , companies producing generic medicines to begin their development work in advance of the expiry of patents ?
we know that this work is done for european companies in turkey and in iceland , for example .
it is costing us jobs here in the european union .
there is more than a little hypocrisy among the large pharmaceutical companies , most of which have generic subsidiaries .
they want to hunt with the hounds and to run with the hare .
in the united states they see the generic medicine sector as an important job creator .
this report calls for the opening of that sector .
all of these would lead to a safer , healthier society with more sustainable medicinal practices and a pharmaceutical industry better geared to meet the challenges of the future .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , a large part of our european identity is based on our system of social protection and , in particular , our system of health insurance .
in this respect , mrs soltwedel has drawn up a very clear and detailed report which deserves our praise .
at the international level , the pharmaceutical sector is going through a period of upheaval , caught between the globalization of competition and cost-cutting measures applied to public health systems .
although europe has a large medicines market , it also fortunately has a great scientific and industrial tradition : something known as good manufacturing practice , a notion which must be preserved .
medicines are an essential factor in protecting health .
the availability , quality , effectiveness and safety of medicines must all be improved - on this point the report is categoric - in order to guarantee treatment or cure for everybody , and also prevention .
in this respect we must always remember the importance of information and the essential health safety on which insufficient stress is laid .
any fudging in this area is to be rejected .
we must impose strict regulations and not leave the market to impose its own rules .
in regard to reagents , which were recently the subject of a debate in this house , we must of course refer to the sad case of the ' abbot ' aids screening tests .
i repeat , it is essential to prevent any backsliding and to establish sufficient health safety not only between the member states but everywhere .
let us learn the necessary lessons from the situation caused by the bovine spongiform encephalopathy prion .
we must not limit the action of the public authorities in this field and confine the pharmaceutical sector to the area of industrial policy alone .
there is also the matter of health and people 's lives to be considered .
i repeat , that is what health safety is all about .
we must also endeavour to increase price transparency , although i know that the treaties do not , unfortunately , yet allow us to cause governments and laboratories to make an effort on this subject .
i am in favour of the use of generic medicines , but we must not dismantle the system of patents , without which there would be no research or investment , the costs of which are a growing burden .
as to gentle and homeopathic medicines , these attract me but also leave me sceptical .
finally , i welcome the creation of the european medicine evaluation agency .
i see this is an excellent first step towards community regulation .
i should like to end by looking at the need for bioethics and also add that i see europe 's increasing drug consumption as harmful .
there are countries which stuff themselves with tranquilizers , but i do not know of any pill against misfortune or unemployment .
it calls the attention of governments and of public opinion to the need to create a social climate conducive to therapeutic research .
we cannot support the report presented by the rapporteur .
the group of the european people 's party has therefore tabled a block of amendments which we think it is essential to approve .
it must not be forgotten that therapeutic progress would be best served by the promotion of innovation as would lightening the future burdens on social security systems .
the best protection of the interests of patients as consumers is the availability of high quality , safe and effective medicines .
we forget that a medicine is an active substance coupled with a process of pharmacological and clinical research , plus information and civil and criminal liability .
medicines known as ' generic ' , which make no contribution to therapeutic or social progress , contribute nothing to that .
it is only a factor of selfregulation and must be taken as such .
many of the speeches made by distinguished fellow-members on this report forget that there is very full legislation in the european union and that this communication deals only with the perspectives of an industrial pharmaceutical policy .
if we had concentrated on that , perhaps we should have achieved a better result and practically full support for the commission 's proposals .
madam president , i too am a small but active minority within the group of the european people 's party .
pharmaceutical research is both costly and time-consuming , and it can take up to ten or twelve years before a new medicine is ready to be put on the market .
in 1993 the average cost of research and development was estimated at ecu 275 million .
you can well imagine that sums like this can only be generated by companies with sufficient cashflow throughout the ten years which it takes to develop a new product .
and not only are the costs high , there is also a considerable element of risk involved .
all of this means that it is only the really big companies that can spare the money for research and development .
i obviously do not want american patent-holders to carry on benefiting once the patent has expired .
the patent period was the reward we offered the industry under the previous gatt system , in return for its investment in developing new products .
so we need to introduce an exemption in europe to allow research into generic medicines to start before the patents on them expire .
we need to allow products to be developed and marketed as soon as possible , so that production costs can be recouped as quickly as possible .
if the house does not support paragraph 17 , we shall simply be relegating our industry still further down the table .
madam president , this debate has shown that our communication was very necessary and , in my view , that we still need to discuss this issue further .
a number of questions have been raised here today which need to be examined in detail .
our communication clearly shows that this is not the case .
the community 's industrial policy in the pharmaceutical sector needs to take account of both the public health and social security aspects , without undermining the member states ' powers in this field .
maybe attacking the commission is just a good way of enlivening the debate , and it is something we are quite accustomed to .
what are the problems here ?
in the 1980s , employment in the sector could be expected to grow by more than 2 % a year on average .
as mrs peijs said , the situation with patents is also looking rather bleak , and this may also explain why employment has fallen .
between 1975 and 1979 , 61 % of all new pharmaceuticals were developed in europe , but the figure dropped to 48 % , in other words to less than half the total , between 1990 and 1994 .
over the same period , the united states ' share grew from 26 % to 31 % and japan 's from 11 % to 31 % .
if we include biotechnology , which is of course one of the major fields of innovation and will become particularly important over the next few years , the situation looks even grimmer .
patents at the clinical and pre-clinical development stage account for 58 % and 48 % of all patents held by american firms , in other words around half .
for european firms , however , the figures are only 26 % and 16 % .
what this means in policy terms is that we are dealing with an industry which is very competitive , even on the international market , but which is also in decline .
this is something the communication naturally also deals with - it is , after all , a communication on industrial policy .
but this is not a health report , and health is not one of my responsibilities .
what is more , the union is not responsible for all health policy matters , and this is a problem i shall come back to later .
the link here is obvious , because the pharmaceutical industry would not exist if it did not work in tandem with the healthcare and in particular the social security systems .
we would seem to be caught in a vicious circle , and it is up to us to find a way out .
the first thing we proposed was to establish a single market in this sector , an idea which has never actually been disputed .
pharmaceutical products should be subject to the rules of the single market , just as other products are .
this does not mean that they should always be treated like other products .
we have introduced a licensing procedure which has , in my opinion , come up to the mark so far , and we shall have to see how it progresses in future .
this was why we visited the agency .
i also have no objection to involving consumers and other organizations in assessing the results of this procedure and in evaluating medicines and the licences granted .
i have no objection to setting up an ethics committee , mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer .
but if you do , you will have to accept its findings , even if you do not agree with them .
this is not the case here , mr langen .
i am a very open person , as you know .
i am even prepared to be friendly , which shows you just how open i am .
what i cannot tolerate , however , is for people to demand an ethics committee and then refuse to accept its findings .
we have an ethics committee on food production and labelling , and i would remind you that it endorsed our views .
we did not ask it to do so , and there was no lobbying .
the members of the committee are completely independent , and they said the commission was right .
we have already dealt with the self-medication issues .
medicines are licensed as prescription drugs , pharmacy drugs or over-the-counter drugs , which means that the system is suitable for use throughout the union .
and - something which is particularly important with new drugs - we have already put in place some of the legal protection called for in this report .
the protection offered by patents can now be extended , in the sense that the unfortunate situation whereby the testing period had to be deducted from the length of the patent no longer exists .
this has already been dealt with , and we do not need to discuss it further .
the usa and japan have even followed our example .
so we are by no means starting from scratch , and what we have to do now is consider what to do next .
we are left with the four problems that mr langen mentioned , which summarize the situation very well .
first of all , which will be more useful : more competition or more regulation ?
i think a combination of the two would work best , both for the industry , for cutting costs , and for consumer supply .
some regulation will of course be required , and we have no desire to limit the powers of the public authorities here .
we need them to exercise their powers , as is entirely right and proper .
but this too is no guarantee .
take bse , for example .
it had nothing to do with competition or the commission , it was the public authorities who allowed it .
experience has shown that making a public authority responsible for something is unfortunately not always the best thing to do .
but this does not , of course , mean that we do not need public involvement in this particular field .
this is why i am convinced that experience is best of all .
you only have to look at the second question mr langen raised , about generic medicines and self-medication , which mrs read also mentioned .
what is the situation here ?
in countries which do not have competitive pricing , such as spain , mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer , where there are fixed minimum prices for medicines , there are practically no generics at all .
90 % of the market for generics is concentrated in four countries : germany , the united kingdom , the netherlands and denmark , because they allow price competition , and this gives generics a chance .
so anyone who wants to bring prices down for the consumer should not run away with the idea that fixed minimum prices are the way to do it .
the opposite is actually the case , since consumption tends to increase with fixed minimum prices .
in other words , mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer , total expenditure is greater with fixed minimum prices than if competition is allowed to set price levels and influence consumer behaviour accordingly .
these are basic market forces , but it is always difficult to have confidence in them , because they seem to be such an artificial mechanism which will inevitably produce bad results .
but this is not what happens .
mrs read is right .
look at how little of the total healthcare budget goes on medicines , for example : 14 % a few years ago , now down to 12 % , and even less in some member states .
hospitals account for the largest proportion , and even there the costs have fallen .
so when we are looking at ways of reducing costs , we should also think about how we can make this work better for us .
this brings me on to the question of how what we do affects the social security systems in the member states .
the council has not said a word on this , nor will it answer any questions about it , for one simple reason .
you are , of course , aware that any interference in these systems has enormous political implications , and we have absolutely no intention of harmonizing the member states ' healthcare systems .
what we actually want to do is to remove the price element from the social security system mechanisms and allow it to be determined by the market .
this will produce two results : low , competitive prices and at the same time proper social protection for patients .
if we succeed in doing this - and we have urged the member states to comply in a special protocol to this communication to the council - we shall already have achieved a great deal .
biotechnology is an extremely important issue here , and will come up again when we look at the patentability of technological discoveries .
i hope that we have now made some progress in this field and that parliament is able to accept the proposal , because there is a very real danger here .
it will not bring us extra jobs either , so what good is such a policy ?
as we can see , biotechnology is really a very important aspect .
finally , there is the question of generic and herbal medicines .
so do not shoot me , i ' m only the piano player , and i shoot back !
on the subject of generics and patent-protected medicines , here too the best idea is to allow both to exist alongside each other .
without innovations there would not be any generics , but at the same time generics play an important role in preventing innovations from becoming so prohibitively expensive that the health sector cannot afford them .
there is a symbiosis between the two : they live off each other .
i find it hard to welcome the idea that laboratory testing is to be allowed before the patent period has expired .
a patent covers only some of the costs that can be incurred in research today , which can run to enormous figures .
someone also pointed out how few medicines have been coming onto the market from research recently .
this is why we need innovations and why they need to be protected .
they can start to compete on price with generics later .
one final comment about mergers , which we also mention in the communication .
of course the competition rules must apply here .
the biggest pharmaceutical company 's share of the market is just under 10 % .
so even among the largest firms , the spread is so great that there will always be competition .
i hope that i have now answered all the points that were raised in the debate , though i am sure that we shall have a good deal more to say on this subject .
it is certainly a sector that is still worth fighting for , but subsidies are not the answer , nor are they what it wants itself , thank goodness .
but it is an industry that is losing its competitiveness , and this is what we must take action to prevent .
mr president , please let me put a supplementary question to mr bangemann , since he was given five times as much speaking time as i was .
before i come back to the pharmaceuticals report , i should just like to put the record straight about bse .
this does not concern you directly , mr bangemann , since it is not one of your responsibilities .
in october , when i went to see mr marchand at the commission to discuss european measures in connection with bse , much was already known which was not made public until six months later .
i am delighted to hear this , and i think it will help to provide much greater protection for patients and consumers .
i should like a straight yes or no on this .
i think you owe it to us to make a clear statement on this point , instead of just referring to what mr langen said .
my final question will probably also be very important for us .
what follow-up will be given to this communication on the pharmaceutical industry ?
can we expect directives or other more compulsory measures for the industry in the next six or twelve months , or will there only be the communication for the time being ?
there was no more to it than that .
i did not say anything about the bse problem as a whole .
of course we could talk about it for hours , but all i actually said was that the example of bse shows that this is not always the case .
i think we would get a good deal further if you did not always suspect me of saying one thing and meaning another .
i am very rarely devious , and i always warn you in advance , so that you know when it is coming .
i said this quite clearly and categorically the first time , and now i have said it again .
naturally a communication such as this is always the basis for further measures .
this will probably be the next item on our agenda , so we shall really want to clarify a few of the points we have mentioned before we produce any further proposals .
there is also the proposal concerning patentability , which i feel is quite important .
once we have dealt with this , we could discuss what else is necessary .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
prevention of drug dependence
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , for this second reading also we have taken into consideration a number of key factors . the first is that drug dependence is no longer a marginal issue .
drug-addicts are not therefore martians : they are , sadly , our children , those who live alongside us .
and if this is our approach to the problem , our starting point , then our response cannot be simple , simplistic , superficial or oversimplified .
what we actually need is to be tough in tackling the problem but also to be willing to talk .
if we are to respond , then we cannot set ourselves apart with our policy or scientific technique - we have to be able to communicate with those working in the field and seeking genuinely to combat drug dependence .
the work with which we , as a committee , tried humbly to make progress is at risk of being undermined .
i want to make that very clear - including to some members of my own group ; i am very much opposed to some of the amendments tabled by the european people 's party also .
but i most particularly disagree with those in the house who are deliberately trying to undermine a vital piece of work , obeying the diktat of certain governments .
i particularly condemn the superficial approach of those who operate on the basis of hearsay ; those who jump from one report to the next without considering the issues in depth .
we cannot tolerate that kind of destructive and superficial attitude to the tragedy of drug-addicts and their families , this social tragedy .
we need - and have proposed this - to make progress on the path to dialogue rejecting all radical approaches .
we have spoken of biological damage but also of the psycho-emotional influence of all drugs , be they soft or hard drugs .
we have described the sociological link between soft and hard drugs , but we also said ' no ' for ethical reasons because we are opposed to drugs sanctioned by the state .
but , just as firmly and energetically as we say ' no ' to liberalization and legalization , we are also opposed to the criminalization of drug addicts because prison neither saves nor rehabilitates them .
prison is a place of damnation : it is in prisons that , very often , drug dependence spreads further .
of course , if a drug addict becomes a pusher , then it is right and necessary that he should pay and answer before the law also .
but the amendment tabled by the committee on the environment , health and consumer protection sought , in cases of that nature too , to place the accent on rehabilitation and not punishment .
a specific commitment to establish certain priorities thus became apparent .
to conclude then , mr president , we say ' no ' to liberalization but , at the same time , no to the criminalization of young drug addicts .
i therefore ask you to reject some of the amendments tabled by the european people 's party , because , as i said at the outset , we cannot take a superficial approach .
we are engaged in a war in which we should all be fighting because we should all consider ourselves very much involved .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would strongly urge the members of this house to approve mr burtone 's report , and the commission and the council to give it their closest consideration .
mr burtone has succeeded in adopting a pragmatic and realistic approach which studiously avoids the usual platitudes .
however , in recent weeks a great deal of nonsense has been talked about the action plan , and in particular about the report itself .
so let us be quite clear about it : this report is not about legalizing or liberalizing any drug whatsoever .
this is a report on a public health issue and certainly does not come under the third pillar .
so let that be an end to all the nonsense .
secondly , at no point does this report approve the taking of drugs .
thirdly , the report stresses the importance of harm-reduction in prevention .
and what is today 's reality ?
what this means is that drugs are not only still available , they are becoming increasingly available .
mr president , i and my entire group are most grateful to mr burtone for his expert guidance in leading us through the first and second readings of this report .
the main focus is on prevention .
how can you stop young people turning to drugs ?
how can you help addicts to give them up ?
how can you limit the health risks ?
the funding available , hfl 12.5 million a year , is merely a drop in the ocean , and is only enough to pay for exchanges of experience , unfortunately .
use european funding for exchanges of experience by all means , but not for specific projects .
we have tabled a number of amendments on this point , and i think it is actually what mr de coene himself would like to see .
the policy of tolerance pursued in the netherlands is not the answer .
it simply makes drugs more easily available and acts as a magnet for addicts from other countries , increasing crime rather than reducing it .
making addiction a crime also does not work .
we wholeheartedly support the harm-reduction policy which the report recommends , and this means that we firmly believe that no distinction should be made between hard and soft drugs .
we have no sympathy , however , with the fatalistic approach adopted by mr de coene , who would have us believe that the fight against those who supply drugs is a lost cause .
tolerance and liberalization are not the answer , since they lead to a vicious circle in which society has to give more and more ground .
on television in the netherlands last sunday a leading socialist , mr tobback , said : ' what has our policy in the netherlands achieved ?
i am the mayor of a city with 35 000 students , and there has not been one single case of a drugs-related death . '
mr president , within every political group in the house there is a majority view and a minority view on the action programme on the prevention of drug dependence .
it is on behalf of the majority of the group of the european liberal , democratic and reformist party that i should like to congratulate mr burtone on his report .
a repressive approach is much more appropriate when applied to large-scale drugs trafficking and organized crime , but it will do nothing to help drug addicts .
it is also right to assume that a completely drugs-free society is nothing more than a pipe-dream , which is being just as realistic as acknowledging that we have a society which uses alcohol and tobacco .
as mr burtone said , we are not talking about life on mars here .
i think it is a pity that the report does not distinguish between hard and soft drugs .
in my country , the netherlands , drugs policy is based on this distinction and has produced very good results in the public health field , compared with other countries in europe .
i am pleased to see that there are a number of amendments which adopt this line in calling for disinfection sets and sterile syringes and needles to be provided in order to combat infectious diseases such as aids .
there are also some very welcome calls , such as in amendment no 23 , for substitute treatments such as methadone to be recognized .
mr president , i think the basic problem is summed up in a report by sir jack stewart-clark for the committee on civil liberties and internal affairs .
in that report it is stated that the g7 financial group considers that in europe and the united states 120 000 million dollars are in circulation bound up with the sale of drugs .
of that amount 85 000 million dollars are laundered in financial institutions .
i think that is the basic problem confronting all the institutions , including the european parliament , which try to deal with such a terrible problem as drug dependence .
we agree with mr burtone 's report and with the inclusion of the amendments at first reading .
those amendments also take into account the social situation of those excluded from society and the social situation of poverty which - not in all cases but in many - leads young people to drug dependence .
in my country 60 % of prisoners are behind bars because of drug dependence , and 40 % of that 60 % have the aids virus .
i know that we do not at present have a majority in parliament who share this view .
the same would apply to alcohol , if only we resolved to get to grips with the problem .
but i do not want to open up the debate on this issue , given the balance of opinion in the house .
one thing worries me : europe has seen a debate of incredible stupidity over recent months .
what are we heading for ?
this really is a bit much to take , ...
this is why our parliament must adopt the burtone report .
i do not agree with everything in it , but it is better than many other things .
mr chirac is a veritable danger to the public when it comes to public health and drugs .
but he will learn as he gets older , he will come to understand , as everybody does .
i therefore approve of the general inspiration behind the report and virtually all the amendments , with the exception of amendment no 8 which refuses to distinguish between hard and soft drugs at the prevention stage .
this is the edifying net result of the policy of repression .
but yet i do not propose to counter the dogma of unprincipled repression with a dogma of liberalization lacking in any public health objectives .
this is a simple , clear and understandable policy .
as long as we fail to courageously advance along this path , crime will continue to prosper from individual tragedies .
mr president , we have now almost finalized the drugs prevention programme .
the common position contains a considerable number of qualitative improvements introduced as a result of amendments proposed by parliament .
it will be easier to allocate funding now that specific projects are planned , which will help both the commission and the member states .
but this is playing into the hands of the drugs dealers , who are indirectly responsible for the destruction of their fellow men .
we reject on principle the acceptance of harm-reduction as a basic approach and addiction as a social phenomenon , since these undermine the very justification for providing assistance .
i therefore also oppose the amendments which aim to have harm-reduction adopted as a strategy .
persuading addicts to kick their drugs habit is a very delicate issue and cannot be governed by any general european strategy .
it is also a curative rather than a preventive measure , and this is not what this action programme is about .
to sum up , i support the common position , but i shall be voting against the burtone recommendation .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should first like to protest against the propaganda on the subject of the burtone report , in the form of the tracts displayed in the corridors of parliament .
i therefore request , as far as possible and in parliament 's interest , the removal of these documents which are posted up all over the place .
now for the real subject of discussion .
repression is clearly in many cases the best form of prevention .
i also observe , as is almost implicit in the report , and extremely explicit in certain amendments - amendments nos 2 and 3 in particular - that a spirit of capitulation lies behind this combat against drugs .
this is totally unacceptable .
i am thinking in particular of amendment no 2 which says that a completely drug-free society is a utopian vision and amendment no 3 which says that the goal should be to limit the adverse effects of drug consumption .
and i did indeed say ' limit ' .
i should like to take an example in the field of economic sciences , namely inflation .
under the pretext that zero inflation is virtually inachievable in a period of economic growth , some economists have always believed that the official policy should be one of low inflation .
in a sense this is exactly what we are trying to do in the field of drugs by saying that , because we cannot totally eradicate them , we should make the official policy that of damage limitation .
as in the case of inflation , and for evident psychological reasons , i believe this to be a mistake .
today it has been made very clear to us that if we want to effectively combat inflation our goal must be zero inflation .
the situation is very similar when we come to drugs .
we must clearly affirm our commitment to combatting them .
another mistake is the way amendment no 4 , for example , suggests that drug addicts are simply people with a health problem .
this is not true : there is indeed a health problem , but also a moral problem and we should not forget this .
sophocles wrote , 2 , 400 years ago in antigone , that the man of knowledge knows how to freely choose between good and evil .
i do not in fact believe we will be helping drug addicts by presenting the whole problem as exclusively a health problem and exempting drug addicts from all responsibility .
on the contrary , i believe this would be presenting them with an additional obstacle when seeking to escape from drugs .
consequently , i believe it is a basic philosophical error to believe that you can dispense with repression in this area .
the human mind is not entirely rational , as we now know thanks to the work of phrenologists such as mac lean , and collective repression is absolutely essential .
it serves no purpose to spend large sums of money if you lack the moral courage .
drugs are spreading because this society is ethically decadent .
we are doomed to failure if we refuse to recognize the moral dimension and only consider the health and sociological aspects .
this is not helping the drug addicts , it is hypocritically allowing the traffickers to go about their business .
what do the traffickers want ?
they want the present situation to continue .
you have been very courageous mr burtone .
you have , through your group , encountered many obstacles .
i have been well aware that you had to steer a course between the two extremes .
it is essential to speak of risk prevention .
but it is not enough .
because here , which is the place to do so and where we can benefit from the experience of others , we must finally acknowledge that we are not making any progress and are in fact regressing .
the lisbon observatory provides us with the tragic figures .
of course there have been arrests and of course drugs have been seized , but drugs are continuing to enter europe in ever larger quantities every year .
the least we can say without making a moral judgment is that the repressive policy is not working .
but that does not mean i favour simply opening up the gates , quite the contrary .
however , i do not believe you are going to get very far by giving equally short shrift to those who want to liberalize and those who simply want to repress .
i greatly admire your courage and this report , but it is not enough .
let us be quite clear : there is racism in drugs .
when i hear of the tragic effects of soft drugs , i think of alcohol and tobacco .
for these are our drugs .
tobacco leads to a dependence estimated at 25 or 35 % .
and what do you do about that ?
but then it 's the state which sells it .
i am speaking from the public health point of view , if you like , but also from a moral and political point of view .
it is tobacco and alcohol which cause most damage in terms of public health .
let us remember this and not demonize other people 's drugs .
we too have our drugs .
what is needed is an economic approach .
we must have the courage to say that we must control , and not simply decriminalize drug use .
just as if you have drunk too much you are not allowed to drive , so if you smoke too much you will not be allowed to drive .
but when you consider that , in my country in particular , there are five million cannabis users , i wonder how we are going to manage to lock them all up .
here in parliament we have the obligation to discuss this matter a great deal more .
we clash with the experience of others rather than listening to it .
we should therefore discuss more among ourselves and benefit from national experiences , both negative and positive .
i believe that this will be progress and that this conference which you mention and which we all want to see , in 1996 , will be a step in the right direction .
finally , we must not demonize any experience or initiative , whether negative or positive .
mr president , drugs are a scourge which destroy our families and kill our young people .
for very many years already the european parliament has concentrated on three courses of action in combatting this tragedy .
firstly , preventing drug addiction , secondly , combatting drug trafficking and the related crime and , thirdly , helping drug addicts to get well again .
today we are interested in the first of these courses of action .
in my eyes this is the most important .
because if drugs lose their attraction for young people , if young people believe that all drugs and stimulants are a threat to the freedom of the individual , the drugs traffic will automatically decline .
finally , let us remember one important principle : programmes undertaken with young people are often far more effective than those undertaken for young people .
i believe that creating a sense of responsibility among those primarily concerned and ensuring their active participation must be a golden rule in preventing drug addiction .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i congratulate mr burtone for the efforts he has made , particularly of late , to tackle the problem with greater clarity but also greater realism .
that then is the reality .
we need then radically to change our approach and we must do this all together , to start with by discussing among ourselves the results so far of prohibition and criminalization .
that is why the most important amendment is amendment no 32 which calls for a conference to be held to discuss scientifically the disastrous results of prohibition and for the international conventions of the united nations to be revised .
mr president , mr burtone has done some wonderful work and he is obviously very concerned about drugs but at the same time i would like to say that i do not share all his views .
like most swedish politicians , my party in sweden , the centre party , can certainly not support the thesis that a drugs-free society is an unattainable utopia .
it is completely mistaken to regard a restrictive policy on all drugs as the antithesis of a policy to reduce suffering and the harmful effects of drug abuse .
however , the european parliament 's proposal will have no effect on swedish laws and regulations , dealing as it does with recommendations for a programme of measures .
unfortunately , however , this type of decision helps to undermine the legitimacy of the european parliament and the confidence of the people of europe in it .
this is an unfortunate consequence of today 's debate .
this debate has also strengthened still further my conviction that the area of criminal law should remain a purely national concern for the member states .
mr president , mr burtone 's report contains a number of different parts .
there are parts that i support , such as the importance that is attached to preventive work and the need for proper care and rehabilitation to help drug addicts give up their abuse .
there are also parts of the report , however , that are not at all acceptable .
it contains a number of more liberal formulations where the policy of what is called ' harm reduction ' is concerned .
this is a philosophy which is aimed at reducing the damage done by abuse , not at combating and putting an end to it .
the report also contains demands for a supranational drugs policy and for a review of existing international conventions .
this is not acceptable .
the un 's drugs conventions should rather be strictly applied by the eu countries as one element in the battle against drugs .
the policy of certain eu countries in the field of drugs today in practice serves to sabotage international cooperation in the fight against drugs .
in the report the issue of drugs is treated as a health issue and dependency as an illness .
drugs are , however , primarily a social and political issue .
the reasons for drug abuse are social conditions , exclusion , unemployment and the lack of future prospects for young people .
the battle against unemployment , social injustice and segregation is thus an important part of the battle against drug abuse - the most important part .
a proper policy for a system of care and rehabilitation which works is also needed .
in this context it is also impossible for society to accept either trafficking in or the possession of drugs - they should be illegal .
there should also be popular opposition to drugs and steadfast and consistent action on the part of the police and customs authorities .
this policy forms a single whole , all parts of which are needed .
mr president , as a socialist i regard the equal worth of all people as a central issue .
i cannot accept that people should be lost to drug abuse .
this is why i would like to see a consistent overall policy with a single goal : a drug-free society .
mr president , it is customary to congratulate a rapporteur .
this report goes against prevailing opinions and the blindness which make a situation which is in itself extremely worrying worse by the day .
so today we are concerned with the question of prevention .
this prevention must clearly be applied to hard drugs in particular , concentrating on intravenous drugs .
it must also be implemented at various levels : the family , schools , universities , associations , municipalities and workshops .
all of these elements must be appraised .
in this respect , holding a conference which would call into question the position of the international community would be very welcome .
mr president , this is one of the absolutely most important issues in europe and the international community as a whole .
it is a matter of how we can best and most effectively tackle the scourge of drugs .
this is a task which places us under an obligation and demands that we , as parliamentarians , accept our responsibilities and do not simply let things rest .
the view expressed by mr burtone 's report is a view which worries me .
it confirms that a re-evaluation is under way of the traditional policy on drugs which used to guide europe and which was the lodestar internationally in work on and the battle against drugs .
it smacks of resignation and lack of enthusiasm .
its message is that the battle against drugs cannot be won - but this is not true .
we know that a restrictive drugs policy combined with a well-developed rehabilitation system produces results .
we know that the fewer the young people who try drugs in the first place , the smaller the number who will become addicted .
this is why preventive work is aimed at young people .
it is by far the most important thing we can do .
it is the most important way of reducing the number of addicts in the future .
a policy which is geared only to reducing the damaging effects of drug abuse which is already taking place sends out completely the wrong signals and devotes resources to a completely wrong objective .
the policy of harm reduction is a policy of negative accommodation .
it is a defeatist policy .
if we are to be successful in combating drug abuse we cannot make distinctions between use and misuse .
nor can we make distinctions between soft and hard drugs .
there is always a risk - irrespective of what we choose to call it - an imminent risk that individuals will become addicted .
i cannot therefore support the burtone report and i hope that this house will be able to produce a more positive and more active policy on drugs .
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin by thanking mr burtone for his report .
it is alarming to see the sharp rise in demand for synthetic drugs , particularly ecstasy , and the careless attitude that people take to these pep-pills , with no thought of the dangers involved .
hopefully , effective addiction prevention measures will succeed in reducing the demand , as they have done in the case of heroin .
i should also like to voice my opposition to any liberalization of drugs , in order to counter the expectation of rising demand .
europe is still seen as a lucrative market where there are profits to be made .
at the same time , any tendency towards liberalization and legalization has the effect of playing down the dangers of illegal drugs and is the greatest obstacle to prevention .
reference is always made in these debates to the consequences of alcohol and nicotine abuse .
not only should these problems be mentioned , but they should be seen as a clear warning , so that we do not end up with the same problems by making soft drugs freely available .
as a practising pharmacist , i oppose any attempt to make hashish or marijuana available from chemists , since that would mean putting drugs on a par with medicines .
instead , i would like to see new models and progress in the area of aid and therapy for drug users , including methadone substitution , though only in the context of therapeutic and psycho-social accompanying measures .
we need to offer improved and more specific counselling and treatment for those who are in danger from , or dependent on , drugs , and their families .
let us support the concept of living without drugs or addictive substances , and let us not trivialize these problems by engaging in a debate that blurs the issues .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am very pleased that the action programme on drug dependence is the subject of discussion in the house today .
90 % of the addicts being treated in my region are under 30 years of age .
we must turn off the tap and stop the continuous supply .
naturally , we must also improve and reinforce treatment programmes .
i welcome the proposals of the common position of the council which include a series of schemes which are clearly more important and more specific than those of the commission 's initial proposal .
efforts must continue in this direction .
in particular , we must increase the resources allocated to treatment cures .
we must also promote improved cooperation between member states and between the competent community bodies in this field .
and would it not also be wise to bring together all the community bodies and agencies active in this area within a single organization ?
it is only by such a pooling of energies that we will be able to effectively combat and eliminate this scourge .
mr president , it is most welcome that we now have our first preventative drugs programme based on health and social considerations .
i hope this is the beginning of better cooperation between the police and home affairs authorities on the one hand and the health and social authorities on the other .
there is a need for cooperation projects between the different authorities .
in finland we have had experience of these problems mainly owing to the import of drugs across our eastern border .
the starting point of drugs policy must be clear : society does not approve of drugs .
the non-medical use of drugs is unacceptable .
when a person learns to regulate his state of mind chemically starting with tobacco and alcohol and ending with drugs , a spiral of exclusion easily starts as a result of over-use .
' legal drugs ' ( tranquillizers ) finding their way on to an illegal market , especially when used in combination with alcohol , are a major and serious problem particularly for young people .
controls must be tightened .
drug education must be carried out skilfully and expertly without shock tactics and together with young people .
further research is also needed .
mr president , i strongly agree with the proposals contained in this report .
for too long in europe we have been concentrating on financial and trade issues at the expense of major social issues such as the drugs problem .
the imbalance has been somewhat redressed by the public health competence given to us by the maastricht treaty .
combined with unemployment and poverty , drugs are laying waste large parts of our cities and destroying the lives of our young people .
in my own city of dublin the number of heroin addicts has been increasing steadily for the last 20 years and is estimated to be about 7 , 000 now .
i would ask commissioner flynn to join with me in urging the irish government to coordinate its efforts with the efforts being made here in europe .
we need , for instance , to increase the size of the drugs squad .
the drugs squad in ireland stands at 1 % of the total force .
that is laughable when 80 % of dublin crime is drug related .
we must also ask for effective coordination between the g&aacute;rdai , the revenue commissioners and the department of social welfare .
it is time that the government came to grips with any remaining industrial relations problems in this area so that the ill-gotten gains of the drug dealers can be targeted .
i visited mountjoy prison recently in dublin .
it is clear to me that a policy of ' containment only ' operates there .
an effective follow-on therapy should be provided for prisoners by the eastern health board .
the ecstasy problem is now escalating out of control and party packs are now widely available in dublin .
we need more education programmes .
i ask the commission to bring forward further programmes along these lines to tackle this life-threatening problem that faces all of europe .
mr president , i have been working on the issue of drugs since the very first committee of inquiry in which i served with sir jack stewartclark .
i found myself pulled in a variety of ways over the years .
very often it is ageing liberals from the ' 60s , like myself , who advocate liberalization , legalization of drugs .
they make a very good case very often .
but generally speaking , the people who take this line are not themselves addicted , are not themselves very often in direct contact with the vast problems related to addiction , and they are complex problems .
of course the element of unemployment and poverty is very significant here .
we need to pay particular attention to our prisons .
contrary to what has been said by the previous speaker , i am happy to tell you that a specialized unit has been opened in the prisons in dublin .
i am sure many colleagues from other countries have experienced the same problem that very often young people in prison , who may not in fact be addicted when they go in , come out addicted .
therefore it is important that one has a unit in prisons where the prisoners themselves can make a choice against drugs .
you will find that a significant number of them will probably make that choice .
while 80 % of the people in our own prisons are there because of drug-connected crime , some of them are not .
this is a contagious disease , as contagious as tuberculosis was in the ' 40s and ' 50s .
we have to treat it like that .
we also have to recognize that our detox and treatment programmes must include not just detox but also an element of teaching life-skills .
you cannot rehabilitate people if many of them have never been habilitated in the first place .
mr president , i know that commissioner flynn shares with us the regret that we do not have total competence in all matters concerned with drugs .
the fact that law and order sits within the third pillar is regrettable .
therefore , this common position is a good first step .
mr burtone has made a sympathetic report and , on the whole , we ought to support this .
my view is that national countries must decide on their own drugs policy .
indeed , if we look at my own country , in scotland and england there are two separate drugs policies .
scotland is more concerned with harm reduction than england .
and here i see an absolutely vital role for the drugs monitoring centre .
that is its value .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the health of the people of the union is something we concern ourselves with as regards foodstuffs and consumer goods .
why should we then not concern ourselves with the health of our fellow citizens where drug abuse and its effects on the brain , lungs and reproductive organs is concerned ?
the policy on drugs must be approached from different angles .
there are no simple solutions .
the goal must be a society free of drugs .
we must find common and national methods which are effective .
the emphasis here must be on prevention and combating drug trafficking , while treatment detection and prosecution are national responsibilities .
if we wish to have the support of the people we cannot use eu resources to finance controversial projects , such as the prescription of heroin .
syringe programmes involving methadon are also controversial , however .
5 % of those who participated in methadon programmes over a period of ten years managed to overcome their addiction - this is not particularly effective .
we should , however , jointly evaluate our special national programmes .
this will also enable us to find a common policy , which will emerge from the results , results which will of course lead to lower demand .
the alternative to this policy is increasing drug abuse and gains for the drug traffickers .
what is important now is to show a willingness to compromise .
this we must do if we are to be able to achieve common measures .
i should also like to thank mr burtone for his commitment to this issue and say that i believe the commission and the council have chosen a realistic , sensible path , which parliament should support .
it is not the drug traffickers but our colleagues in the european institutions that we should support .
every time drugs are discussed in the european union , tempers flare - this time between france and the netherlands .
i am alarmed at how all the protagonists in the debate portray their own opinion as the only legitimate one .
this is an accusation often levelled at mr chirac , but in my experience it is at least as true of those , within and outside this house , who make a fetish of liberalization .
as far as the ppe group is concerned , the contradiction that is often drawn between help and punishment does not exist .
both are necessary if the problem is to be tackled truly effectively .
the swedish model seems to me the most successful one at present .
throughout the debate today , and indeed on other occasions , i have heard no convincing argument against the swedish model , and i see no reason why it should not be a model for europe as a whole .
in the light of that , i am also irritated by the debate between my country - germany - and the netherlands .
our foreign minister , mr kinkel , said recently in the hague that nobody wished to interfere in the drugs policy of the netherlands , but the german government as a whole takes a different view .
i wonder whether mr kinkel has forgotten that we are in the third year after maastricht .
the dialogue about combating drugs is not interference : it is european domestic policy .
to my mind , the third point is of particular importance .
mr president , i first of all thank all those who have contributed in such a sincere and dedicated way .
obviously it is a debate that touches a lot of people 's concerns in the house .
the text before you today for this second reading is the council 's common position on the first programme for community action to prevent drug dependence .
we all agree on the need for such a programme and the need to adopt concrete measures to combat drug abuse at european level .
as you know , the initial proposal has been extended following the incorporation of some 21 amendments which were proposed by parliament and which were supported by the commission either fully or partially .
the council took on board many of the amendments , sometimes , i have to say , in a different form .
i believe that considerable progress has been made in arriving at a text which is acceptable to all the community institutions .
i accept that there is need for some further work to be done so that we can resolve the differences that exist .
for its part the commission could not accept the council 's common position for two principal reasons .
they have both been referred to here .
the council wants to reduce the overall budget for the five-year programme from ecu 28.5m to ecu 27m .
the commission finds this unacceptable given that the common position which has been suggested by the council substantially extends the scope of the original proposal .
it wants to extend the scope and still reduce the money .
we find that unacceptable .
secondly , the management committee , a structure which is proposed by the council , is inappropriate for such a very small-sized programme .
the commission supports the setting up of a purely advisory committee , both as a matter of principle and in order to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens .
i remain of that view , notwithstanding the decisions taken on the committee structure for the three other health programmes recently approved under the codecision procedure .
i would like to turn to the commission 's position on the 32 amendments proposed by the rapporteur in the second reading .
twelve are acceptable to the commission , mr burtone , fully or in part .
these are nos 3 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 26 , 27 , 28 and 31 .
amendment no 4 : this statement is already covered by recital 1 of the common position and by amendment no 6 .
amendment no 5 : amendment no 7 describes the objectives of the programme in greater detail without reference to the objectives of a policy on drugs .
amendment no 6 : the first statement is fully acceptable since it confirms the public health approach to the scourge but the second part falls outside the community powers under article 129 .
amendment no 9 is already covered by amendment no 7 .
amendment no 13 : the content of this amendment is covered by amendment no 15 which is acceptable to the commission .
amendment no 18 : the tasks of the emcdda are dealt with in the regulation establishing it and it cannot be modified through this programme .
amendments nos 19 , 20 and 21 : i have already underlined the commission 's position concerning the nature of the committee foreseen by article 5 of the proposed decision .
furthermore , i would like to point out that amendments nos 19 and 21 are not in the line with the decisions taken by the three health programmes that were adopted at the beginning of this year .
amendments nos 22 and 37 : the activities foreseen in these amendments are not in line with the principle of subsidiarity and would exceed the budgetary possibilities of the programme .
amendment no 23 : the commission was supportive of the evaluation and exchange of experience in the fields mentioned in the amendment and this has been incorporated into the common position .
amendment no 24 : the commission considered that these activities are already included in the common position under generic provisions .
amendment no 29 : the prevention of drug dependence and associated risks with the support of the activities of relevant bodies is the main aim of the programme and it is already underlined in the council text .
so , having reviewed these various amendments , i would again like to express my appreciation for the work of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
i hope that the adoption of this programme will in due course support , relaunch and act as a catalyst for common efforts to prevent drug dependence and to help drug users .
mr president , i wish to speak briefly to express , certainly , my appreciation for the efforts made by the commissioner to align the commission position and that of the house .
but significant differences remain , both with the commission and with those who have tabled amendments on behalf , among others , of the epp , the effect of which is to distort the work done so far .
i repeat : we have taken a consistent line , a far from easy path ; at any rate , we have tried to respond to a tragic problem - the problem of drug dependence in europe .
those are the approaches we stressed in the difficult debate held in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection and , subsequently , in the house .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
votes
madam president , we would like a separate vote on amendments nos 5 and 6 .
madam president , i was under the impression that we had agreed that if we wanted a separate vote on anything , we had to say so in advance .
i naturally agree with mr pompidou , but i think we have to be consistent , otherwise we cannot carry on .
mrs oomen-ruijten , you are perfectly right in the case when there is a recommendation from the committee responsible .
that is why i initially stated that there had not been any recommendation from the committee responsible in the case of these amendments .
there is not therefore any problem .
excuse me for intervening once again , madam president , but we also want a separate vote on amendments nos 22 and 23 .
( the president declared the common position adopted as amended )
i should like a separate vote on amendment no 16 , madam president .
mrs oomen-ruijten , on this occasion the committee responsible has recommended a block vote on amendments nos 12 , 16 , 19 , 21 .
furthermore , your request for a separate vote does not seem to have reached us before the deadline laid down by rule 116 .
i am sure you will understand the difficult situation this puts me in .
we did everything according to the rules , madam president .
mrs oomen-ruijten , as you were able to appreciate this morning , we are introducing a system which is , let us say , rather more constraining and rigid than we are used to .
i believe we should be pragmatic and allow ourselves a certain flexibility in moving towards the strict application of this system , as we are not voting machines .
this is why i am going to allow a separate vote on amendment no 16 .
when you are president mr anastassopoulos , you will be perfectly free to be as inflexible as you like .
for the sake of fairness , madam president , if we have a sperate vote on amendment no 16 , we request the same for amendments nos 19 and 21 .
mr pompidou , you are seeking to shamelessly profit from the situation !
no , madam president , it is in the interests of consistency .
i am sure , mr pompidou , that you will withdraw this request which was made in order to inject a little humour into the vote .
no , madam president , my group is with me .
i cannot decide alone to withdraw this request .
( the president declared the common position adopted as amended )
madam president , i wanted to say a word on this point as i once again presented the table which failed by just one vote to win the commission 's support .
but i should like to draw attention to the fact that having approved the previous text we will be contradicting ourselves if we do not adopt the amendment which i propose .
yesterday commissioner papoutsis , who was here , demonstrated the coherence between the text we have just adopted and the table i propose .
this is why i invite you to vote in favour of my amendment , especially as the commission and parliament must succeed in convincing the council .
madam president , i should like to support the amendment .
i do not think there is any contradiction here .
the committee approved the table unanimously because , in the table , priorities are established very clearly , perhaps more clearly than in the broader brush-strokes of the text .
as i said , however , there is no contradiction here , and the committee approved this table unanimously .
thank you sir .
the house is sufficiently well-informed to vote in full knowledge of the facts .
after the adoption of the ' table ' part of amendment no 27 :
madam president , the table i referred to was , of course , that of the committee , not the table submitted by mr soulier and the ppe .
it is really quite straightforward , because the committee presented and approved this table , not the one that was submitted by the ppe .
i would therefore ask that the vote be retaken , because what i said clearly created some confusion .
so to recap and to make it quite clear : the committee 's table is not the same as that of the ppe .
mr lange , i believe that there is in effect some confusion .
i believe that for my part i have been very clear .
i put to the vote amendment no 27 by the european people 's party .
the rapporteur then requested to speak in order to explain why he was in favour of this amendment and why he had tabled it .
you spoke giving the impression that you supported it , but that is your affair .
this amendment was put to the vote once again and i made it quite clear which one we were dealing with .
we will not be taking this vote again .
that would not be right .
i believe that everything was very clear .
i should like to protest .
it is indeed normal for a rapporteur to speak on behalf of the committee .
but in this case we were misled for the simple reason that the rapporteur did not speak on behalf of his committee , but on behalf of his group .
that is not at all normal .
mr dankert , i listened carefully to the rapporteur , especially as he spoke in my language so there was no possible interpreting error .
i most definitely did not hear mr soulier refer to the ppe group .
i was really very attentive and i tell you this quite simply .
we will not be taking this vote again , it would not be right to do so .
everything was very clear .
i should simply like to say this , madam president .
on this basis , it was therefore preferable to support amendment no 27 by mr soulier rather than to maintain amendment no 26 by our committee on research , technological development and energy .
i assure members of my group that everything was conducted properly .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
there has been no movement on the thermie programme , a programme on renewable energy , which is being held up by the council .
it is therefore all the more important that we , as a parliament , get it implemented and make the council and the commission put their money where their mouth is .
otherwise , we in the eu will gradually become a laughing stock !
i would not go so far as to call us liars , but absolutely nothing is happening !
high-sounding words about the need for energy efficiency and co2 reduction are being bandied about , but nothing is being done !
it is all hot air .
otherwise , we shall make problems when it comes to the budget .
the proposal for a council decision concerns an exceptionally important area for the union 's member states in terms of the economy , the environment and supply policy : the promotion of energy efficiency .
it is vital , therefore , to extend the save programme for a new five-year period with a view to a more rational use of our scarce resources .
there is no point in not legislating in this area - on grounds of the principle of subsidiarity - in view of the cross-border nature of the problems associated with co2 .
recommendation for second reading by mr von wogau
we assume that the customs 2000 programme is concerned with agreeing at community level criteria for the minimum level of the controls to be carried out .
since the various member states today have different legislation governing such subjects as drugs and arms control we do not consider that it will be possible to arrive at a common interpretation of the powers of customs authorities .
in our opinion each member state should itself be allowed to decide on the level of controls to be carried out at its borders with other eu countries .
we are therefore very pleased today , at second reading , to see that the council has since taken the same line as ourselves and rejected parliament 's most contestable amendments .
as could have been expected , the european parliament has returned to the attack with amendments which my group voted against .
now , under the pretext of improving external controls , the proposal is to move towards ' communitization ' .
this is to make another mistake , and for three reasons .
i approve of parliament 's insistence in giving the community ' customs 2000 ' programme more force and substance faced with the hesitations of the co-legislator , the council .
the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy thus wants to step up the fight against fraud through harmonized and reinforced customs .
in the face of third parties , common tariffs must be matched with common customs .
this means imposing strict rules everywhere where there are customs , and not rules which vary from one member state to another .
such a programme can encourage the european union to advance in this direction , but we must of course show we are serious in implementing the programme , in particular when it comes to the controls .
each member state must provide its customs with the technical and human resources necessary to fulfill this task .
i stress in particular the importance of continuing high-level training supplementing the initial training which each customs officer receives in his country of origin .
this continuing training , to be given at a european customs academy , will be a vital asset for european customs officers working at external borders and involved in the fight against fraud .
we have voted today against almost all the amendments to the community action programme ' customs 2000 ' , since we believe that they do not respect the individual member states ' sovereignty .
it should still be up to each member state to decide how they wish to control their borders , train their personnel , etc .
practically all the member states have different laws on the importation of different kinds of goods , e.g. drugs and arms .
that is the way it should be in the future as well , and that is why we see no grounds for harmonizing legislation in this area .
the european parliament has now approved , at second reading , its definitive version of the ' customs 2000 ' action programme .
i hope that , as the next step , the council of ministers will signal its acceptance of the following important proposals from parliament :
drug abuse is one of the worst scourges with which europe has to contend .
it is therefore also extremely important that strategies for combating drugs are chosen with care .
we are of the opinion that the proposals put forward in the burtone report are geared too much to measures to reduce the harm caused by existing abuse .
we believe this is far too late .
greater emphasis ought to be placed on preventive work , particularly among young people .
we know that the fewer the young people who try drugs in the first place , the smaller the number who later become addicted .
we also believe that it is wrong to make a distinction between hard and soft drugs or between use and abuse .
the problem of where the line should be drawn will always arise and any ambiguity about what is acceptable and what is not will only send mixed signals to our children and young people .
a drugs policy aimed at restriction and prevention is the common path we ought to take , in order to be able to combat drugs effectively .
resignation and an ever increasing level of tolerance will only have the opposite effect .
the drug abuse issue is at heart a question of democracy and human rights : all men and women should have control over their own bodies .
a person dependent on drugs can never be free to exercise such control .
it is highly regrettable that the council does not have a point of view to match the scale of the problem of drug dependence and the essential need for prevention .
there must be no holds barred when it comes to combatting the drug dealers , those peddlers of death , and those who specialize in laundering drug money , the financiers behind organized death .
drug addicts must be saved from these people .
they must be cared for and allowed to benefit from the widest possible prevention , one which certainly includes a genuine european health programme but which also extends to other community policies .
the council must accept the cooperation which must be implemented .
the council must see drug addicts as people in distress who must be brought back into society and not as delinquents .
consequently ( and this is a long-term goal ) , we must first give drug addicts the means to avoid the spread of risks linked to drug consumption .
we cannot rescue them from their dependence overnight .
also , together with prevention pure and simple , which is a means of avoiding the use of drugs , we must protect addicts from the still greater risks they run .
i therefore fully support the burtone report , which we must adopt with a very large majority .
i hope that the commission will support our approach .
i invite the council to show greater realism and commitment in implementing this programme .
its very credibility is at stake .
what upsets me and greatly concerns many swedish people and other europeans is the tenor of the amendments tabled by mr burtone and the committee .
certainly it is important to help drug addicts .
it is at least equally important , however , to prevent young people and others being drawn into drug abuse .
clear signals are needed from the authorities of european states .
this is why i voted against central elements of the burtone report .
the fact that i have abstained from voting in favour of the report on the prevention of drugs , does not mean that i am not in favour of preventing the drug problem .
i am , to the greatest possible extent .
however it is precisely prevention of , as opposed to combating , this serious problem which is best undertaken at national state level .
the states themselves are best able to assess which policy and what resources in their particular circumstances - including cultural norms - will produce optimal results .
earlier , the burtone report caused considerable conflict between the majority , who are liberal on drugs , and most of the swedish members .
in the proposal which has now been adopted some of the proposals from those who are liberal on drugs have been removed .
it has also been established that it ' is not advisable to draw a sharp distinction between soft and hard drugs ' .
does this mean that the information provided by sweden has had an effect ?
this is possible and , if true , it is hopeful sign .
the report still contains a number of elements which the environmental party cannot support :
on the contrary , it is only if we tackle and reduce drugs dependence with enough political will and sufficient means that we will actually be able to attack this problem from every aspect .
the consumption of various kinds of drugs , including so-called hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine , has assumed dramatic proportions over the last 20 years .
it is not surprising therefore that many eu citizens today regard drug abuse as one of the greatest of all social problems .
nor can there be any doubt that this cross-border problem must , and will , be solved by means of a combination of national and international measures .
in this light there is every reason to welcome the commission 's proposal for a programme of action for the prevention of drug abuse .
i fully support these proposals to improve the community 's programme of action .
recommendation for second reading by mr castricum
the proposed interoperability of the transeuropean high-speed rail system is a good project .
but it only has any meaning if it is accompanied by a financial plan allowing europe to complete the efforts made by the individual member states .
we must apply the principle of subsidiarity and too often the european union intervenes illegitimately in matters which are normally within the sphere of competence of the member states .
but in this particular case it is surprising that the european union is not pledging major financial support for this ultimate transborder project .
let me take the example of the east high-speed rail link , running from paris to strasbourg , vienna and budapest . in addition to the efforts of the member states , this project also needs community funding .
the european union should redirect its efforts at genuine transborder projects .
taken overall , this would not increase expenditure but rather reduce it .
i should like to see a financial report one day complement the present report .
i believe there is an urgent need for this .
recommendation for second reading by mr cornelissen
i consequently welcome the work done in this report , to tighten up the regulations , and i am therefore able to support the report .
soulier report
total world consumption of energy is increasing , particularly in the developing countries .
unfortunately , this increase in consumption will primarily take the form of greater use of fossil fuels , increasing emissions of co2 into the atmosphere as a result .
in order to militate against this trend as much as possible , it is of paramount importance that the eu continues and intensifies its transfer of know-how in the energy sector to the developing countries .
as a step towards this end the eu should , for example , make all the useful data and experience gained from the eu save ii programme available to the developing countries .
soltwedel-sch&auml;fer report
madam president , the report by mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer is full of comments and proposals which show both good sense and goodwill .
however , certain points are unacceptable .
first of all , we completely rule out even a partial standardization of the social protection systems of the member states ( in order to harmonize the reimbursement amounts for medicines ) .
secondly , you must be careful when promoting so-called generic medicines .
thirdly , we are highly suspicious of the praise of self-medication .
this opens the door to all kinds of abuses and dangers .
we must never forget that medicines are an active product which must be treated with care .
we must therefore never lose sight of the all-important role of the pharmacist and physician in terms of information and control and not seek to sacrifice this at the altar of illfounded economic arguments .
the most important consideration in all of this must be public health .
despite these major reservations , we voted in favour of this report .
community guidelines for an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry must take account of the fact that the trade in medicines does not take place under normal market conditions .
it is not an invisible hand which determines demand , supply and price , it is the representatives of interest groups and government authorities which exercise a considerable influence over sales , consumption and profits .
this has a number of consequences .
' pharmacon ' means both medicine and poison , something healing and something deadly .
it goes without saying that you cannot obtain goods of this kind freely , nor can you supply them unsupervised .
we can also understand why the state , the health insurance funds , patients ' associations , doctors ' organizations , universities and the pharmaceutical sector are all involved in the creation and distribution of medicines .
the european union 's interest , and particularly that of the european parliament , lies in both the industrial and public health aspects .
as a member of the two committees asked for their opinion , i agree with the draft proposal in principle .
it is a sensible and balanced compromise between the different interests of the pharmaceutical industry , social security , research organizations , the health insurance funds , the medical profession and consumers ' organizations .
i do feel , however , that we need a clear definition of innovations .
a real innovation is a new medicine , not an existing medicine that is given a new description or a ' me too ' medicine which is brought out as a derivative years after a genuine innovation .
a real innovation is used to cure previously incurable or untreatable diseases and conditions , or offers better treatment for certain complaints or a better chance of curing them than existing medicines .
all in all , i feel that this proposal is a step in the right direction .
a policy on pharmaceuticals must take account of the competitiveness and profitability of the sector as a whole - industrial policy - and of employment , public health , medical progress and social security - social policy .
i believe that the proposal on which we are to vote meets all the requirements of sound policy , both industrial and social .
that concludes voting time .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
discharge for 1991 , 1992 , 1993 and 1994
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , i would not have objected to my danish colleague , eva kjer , speaking first .
what we are talking about here is 60 billion danish kroner .
this year the coal and steel union is the only body to have been awarded an unconditional statement of assurance , and that is incredibly good .
i would , however , like to start by congratulating the commission on the fact that the bagnoli case is now finally concluded .
for four years i have protested about a ten-year-old matter concerning the missing interest payments which the italians tried to cheat us out of .
the commission has succeeded in recovering this money .
it is a couple of million danish kroner , but it is something at least , as taxpayers will understand , that money which had been paid out unlawfully , has been repaid .
we should almost put the flags out to celebrate the fact that , on 11 october 1995 , the commission was finally able to resolve this matter .
but then we begin to have some of the minor points we have problems with . the solvency ratios .
we adopted a directive in 1992 , and now we are even contravening the actual solvency ratio directive .
that is to say that we have excessive external investments .
the key factor is risk spreading , and it is being confined to fewer and fewer debtors and bigger and bigger commitments .
i can quote a couple of figures . there are 11 debtors whose loans exceed 25 % of the ecsc 's net assets .
the main commitments exceed 800 % of net assets , which means that the risk is not sufficiently spread .
we may run the risk of some momentous events occurring whereby we suddenly sustain some losses , but perhaps we are running over into next year 's discharge procedure now .
but what if , for example , we are involved in a bankruptcy in connection with the tunnel between france and england ?
then the eu system loses - and wait for it everybody - over 10 billion danish kroner , and that is when things start to get problematic .
that is to say , therefore , that even if the accounts have been properly kept , there have still been shortcomings .
that is one of the things i am really aware of , and i have asked for a list of the types of guarantees we have .
i have been promised it by the commission , but have not yet received it .
we do not seem to be very good at speculating in securities either .
now we shall have to wait until the market changes and the rate goes up to recover the money .
let us look at another problem , for example the paris affair .
we have covered it up here in the accounts .
28 % of the investments which should have been paid back to the ecsc have not been received , and that amounts to ecu 1.68 million .
that means that the figures are being massaged , and i would therefore ask the commission to sort things out and stop using all these tricks to hide the figures .
i also wonder , in regard to all the properties we have at our 126 embassies around the world , whether the accounts have been tampered with there as well ?
these are some of the things which i , at any rate , will try to investigate when we get to next year 's discharge .
they have had god knows how many million kroner in interest allowances and , according to the commission 's legal service , we have no chance of recovering them .
in short , the commission should be brave and take a political step to get the money back .
finally , mr president , england has received over 50 % of the loans earmarked for four countries .
we cannot have that .
it is interesting when an english government does this .
prime minister major is behaving like a flirtatious woman ; asking all and giving nothing .
he may well like our money , but he does not like the eu .
i call upon mrs theato to speak on a point of order .
mr president , i did not quite understand why the order of the reports was changed .
i was told that the president-in-office would attend our debate and hear at least the first reports .
i would greatly appreciate your confirmation on this point .
my fear is that we will waste time by making further changes and failing to adhere to the agreed timetable .
the order was changed , mrs theato , solely because mr blak had important business preventing him from attending later .
all the other reports will be dealt with in the order envisaged .
the council will be able to speak , but it seems that there is some delay because of the trialogue which is taking place .
i call upon mr tomlinson for a point of order .
mr president , following on from the question that mrs theato has raised , the council itself fixed the time for the trialogue .
so it has deliberately double-booked itself .
to be in another room having the trialogue while the debate on discharge is taking place in this house is unacceptable conduct .
the council fixed the trialogue .
it determined when it was going to be .
it decided that in this debate , which rests on its recommendation , it can waltz in here whenever it wants and make its speech without having heard the debate .
i hope therefore , mr president , that you will consider denying the floor to the council when it arrives , because it has treated this house with disdain and contempt .
we should show it the same .
mr president , i am astonished that we are holding this debate on the discharge without having the commission here .
how can we expect people to take parliament seriously if it operates like this ?
i have been an elected representative for 25 years , but i have never experienced anything like this .
will you arrange for a representative of the commission to come here without delay ?
it is quite impossible to proceed with the discharge debate under these circumstances .
mr president , on the same point .
i was just going to make the move for adjournment and i am supported by a large number of members from all round the house .
mr president , i have just come from the trialogue and commissioner liikanen is indeed tied up there as is the president-in-office .
we left here when voting finished at 1 p.m. , went directly to the trialogue and for approximately 45 minutes the trialogue has been adjourned so that the presidency can sort itself out .
the way it has tried to conduct the meeting during the last two hours has been an absolute disgrace . i cannot see an end to it within the next two hours .
i do not know if the room is booked . i have come out because i have two reports on the agenda .
but you have a problem , mr president .
perhaps someone can get some information from the meeting room as to when they expect to be finished . that would help members considerably .
mr wynn , ladies and gentlemen , i shall suspend the sitting for ten minutes .
i have sent someone to ask whether after these ten minutes we can expect the council and the commission .
if the council and the commission say they cannot guarantee to be here in ten minutes , i shall put it to the vote whether or not we should continue with the debate .
( the sitting was suspended at 3.10 p.m. and resumed at 3.20 p.m. )
ladies and gentlemen , i have been in contact with the commission and the council .
the commissioner has been kind enough to come straight away .
as regards the council , we are told that they are discussing a document at the moment and will be another quarter of an hour .
i therefore put to the vote the question whether the debate should continue .
( parliament decided to continue with the debate )
mr president , i warn in advance that god help the council if it comes in here wanting to lecture us for half an hour on a debate it has not heard .
i hope you make that abundantly clear to the president-in-office before he walks into this room .
we were treated with disdain in committee when we were sent a civil servant to give what after all is a political recommendation .
we made it quite clear in committee that was unacceptable conduct by the presidency .
we have been treated with contempt again this afternoon and what we will not put up with is some sort of lecture on a debate which the council has not had the courtesy to listen to .
i hope the representative of the council can make that quite clear to the presidency before it comes to the chamber .
it will save some of us the embarrassment of having to say it again directly to the council when it arrives .
thank you , mr tomlinson .
the council has a distinguished representative here who will naturally report these points of view .
you know that it is not for me to censor what the council wishes to say in this assembly and you will receive the appropriate answers in parliamentary terms .
i therefore call upon the rapporteur , mrs kjer hansen , to present her report .
the agricultural policy has become so complex that it must be radically simplified and reformed before the accounts can be closed efficiently .
i hope that message will be an important consideration in any discussion of future agricultural policy .
it is also a problem that agricultural expenditure is paid via the eu budget only .
naturally , the member states do not , therefore , have the same interest in exposing irregular payments which may have taken place .
it is quite simply a clash of interests between the commission and the member states in that expenditure is not shared .
the procedure for closing the accounts is far from satisfactory for several reasons .
the commission does not have sufficient resources to carry out the procedure satisfactorily .
the scope of the audit is minimal compared with the transactions made .
there are areas where no checks have been made whatsoever for years .
it is also difficult to carry out proper checks owing to the large numbers of bodies involved in paying out funds in the member states .
in many cases it seems to be pure guesswork as to what sums are to be collected .
only 7 % of the corrections made in the 1991 budget are individual corrections .
the rest are ' standard ' corrections , i.e. the commission estimates or , more correctly , guesses what sums or what percentages are to be recovered .
the member states accept the corrections in the majority of cases , but we have also seen a number of examples of disagreements which have then been brought before the court .
i therefore welcome the fact that a conciliation board has been set up to enable the member states and the commission to enter into conciliation in the event of a dispute .
the critical problem with the procedure for closing the accounts is that what should have been a technical procedure has , in reality , become a political negotiation .
the assessment which the commission makes is made the subject of negotiation between the commission and the member state in question .
we have seen a number of examples of this .
of course , both good and bad things might be said about such negotiations , but the fact is that there is no question of objectivity .
another well-known example is the milk quota affair .
we have previously discussed this in great detail , but allow me to emphasize all the same that negotiation and political pressure predominated over the fact that there was a case of an unlawfully paid sum .
the whole matter ended up as political horsetrading , and the best that can be said about the milk quota affair is that the public got to hear all about it as it unfolded .
the fact that there is often negotiation between the commission and a member state means that the law is not necesseraly upheld .
the risk that the member states are not given the same treatment exists , whether it occurs consciously or is merely a reflection of accidental discrimination .
of course there are other member states which find this so-called flexibility quite acceptable , because they believe it could be in their interests .
the problem is , however , that the idea behind the closure of the accounts is to recover expenditure not actually entitled to support .
the system suffers from numerous failings and the most serious is that it does not ensure , and does not seek to ensure , objectivity in closing the accounts , so that the amounts recovered reflect actual losses .
i recommend that discharge be given for this area , not because it deserves to be , but because it is the natural thing to do if we are to be consistent and follow up an earlier decision .
mr president , the discharge for the 1992 budget has caused something of a stir .
could i ask the commissioner how much of the ecu 1.6 million has now been paid ?
a few points were left over at the end of the discharge debate last year , such as the inquiry into tobacco fraud in greece and italy .
am i right in thinking that very little work has been done on the investigation in greece ?
when will parliament be informed about the probable scale of the fraud and the measures that have been taken ?
does the commission share my view that this is hardly what one could call sound financial management ?
finally , there was the failure to recover ecu 170 m from spain for the nonapplication of milk quotas in 1989 .
this is an extremely serious matter .
it means that the commission makes the application of the treaty and the principle of equal treatment conditional on a protest from one or more of the member states .
i realize that most of these decisions were taken by the previous commission , but i insist on having a clear explanation from the present one .
the handling of the issue of funding for slaughtering calves in the netherlands is further undermining the credibility of the commission 's financial policy .
i know that the commission is to make a statement tomorrow , but perhaps the commissioner responsible for the budget and budget control could say something now about this ' spend , spend , spend ' approach .
let me explain what i mean .
i think this is an extremely serious matter which undermines the credibility of the entire commission .
can the commissioner explain how this is supposed to be consistent with the strict financial management which mr santer announced , and on which i congratulated him ?
after all , the proof of the pudding is in the eating , as they say , so i would like a detailed reply from the commission on this fundamental question .
mr president , these eight reports for joint debate represent something rather new in the community this year because the maastricht treaty instructs the court to produce a statement of assurance each year on the community 's finances .
it does not tell the court how to do it nor does it tell parliament what to do with it .
i was preparing to follow mr wynn with my remarks and now i find that i am playing st john before him !
the court devoted considerable resources to the das ( statement of assurance ) and that fact is obvious when you see the shortcomings or look for the holes in the annual report for 1994 .
i look to the new president of the court to bring about a restructuring of the working methods of the court .
i asked for that last year and i ask for it again because we need to see the court so organized that it can actually produce an annual report and the statement of assurance .
this leaves it , i know , hard pressed but if it acted more like an international firm of auditors and rather less like a pale copy of the european commission , it might be more successful .
the second problem follows the receipt of the das by the european parliament .
this has led to considerable discussion in the committee on budgetary control .
i strongly support the answers provided by mr wynn , which he will give later and which can be found in his explanatory statement .
he sets the das and the constitutional position of das in its proper context because all the european council did was just request that the court produce the statement .
it did not say how the court should do it and it did not say what we should do with it .
now my friend mr blak has had to depart .
it is a matter of breaking the windows and running away .
last year i said about him ' i regard him as the man in charge of the european coal and steel community .
he does a splendid job . '
however , with his remarks about the closure of coalmines , he has allowed his party politics to get the better of his normally sound judgment .
he is at it again this year !
it is true to say that he makes it clear the united kingdom has not acted illegally .
there has been no question of deliberate wastage of european coal and steel community funds .
while one of the mines was closed in 1990 , the markham main colliery has been mothballed , in that it is under repair and maintenance so that it can be used in the future .
we shall vote against his paragraph 11 .
if i may turn to dublin , that is a fairly easy task because the committee on budgetary control has no hesitation in recommending that discharge be given for the 1994 year .
i am delighted that it has been reported that the saga about property in dublin is at an end. this has gone on far too long and that worry is now behind us .
but the problem of financial control at dublin is not yet settled .
we recommended last year that the commission appoint a part-timer to carry out this work and this has not yet been done .
the pattern of work , the financial regulation and the court 's advice seem to conspire to produce too much cash in hand at any one time .
if the court , the commission and the foundation cannot get it right , they should propose an amendment to the financial regulation because the advice conflicts from year to year .
i hope that the house will endorse the committee on budgetary control 's recommendation that discharge for the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions in dublin be granted .
it is not such an easy story when we turn to the european centre for the development of vocational training , cedefop as we call it ; there are much more serious problems there .
i hasten to add that the problems are not mainly of the centre 's making - they are not its fault at all .
it must have been a prime instance of european cock-up theory which prompted the european council to transfer cedefop from berlin to thessaloniki .
i really believe that it was their intention to transfer the east european training foundation - who were temporary tenants of cedefop in berlin - to thessaloniki .
but as the king had spoken , the move had to take place .
the commission did not help because it indulged in some appalling labour relations so that more than half of the staff were not prepared to move .
i do not think parliament helped either because we had asked for independent consultants to come in and review the work of cedefop .
they chose to come in just at the time when morale was under the floorboards because the staff were not happy with the arrangements that were being made .
the court produced a fairly critical report on this point , but the consultants went so far as to suggest that the centre was not a great deal of use to the community .
i do not think the committee on budgetary control is the right body to make a qualitative assessment as to the centre 's usefulness and future use .
that is the work for the spending committee .
my view is that as long as there is a growing demand for the centre 's reports they must be doing some useful research which people want to get hold of .
that is a good commercial justification .
that work deserves an even higher priority .
rather than condemn cedefop out of hand by refusing discharge , we propose that discharge should be deferred .
the budgetary control committee recommends to the house that we defer discharge to cedefop for the time being .
i finish with an appeal to the commission and everybody else concerned to look at what is happening to the management boards for both dublin and thessaloniki .
there are now more people on the management boards than there are people working in the centre .
the founding fathers ' original idea was to get the social partners to talk together - that is a good thing - government , employers and trade unions .
but if you have one representative from each of the 15 member states and the efta countries and representatives from the commission , you have got boards of 60 people .
they meet twice and their bureau meets three or four times .
there must be a better way of doing it which would look more sensible to europe 's citizens .
i appeal to the commission to instigate an enquiry as to how this can be improved .
if that applies to the past , then we also welcome the sem 2000 proposals and hope that in the future things will be far better .
the problem when we give discharge is the fact that 80 % of the union 's budget is spent by the member states , and we all know this .
unfortunately , we do not give discharge to the member states , we only give discharge to the commission .
a lot of the specific subject areas within the report will be covered by people who follow me .
i just want to concentrate on one issue and one issue only , which has been referred to by mr kellett-bowman , and that is the das .
the das will enhance the sound financial management of the community 's budget - we all accept that - but there are problems , as the court of auditors indicated .
we asked it to specify individual cases and sub-totals based on substantial errors reported by the court ; then we asked it to inform parliament of the action taken in both cases .
so we await the commission 's response on that .
this was the first statement of assurance .
the results of the court of auditors ' report on the commission were somewhat mixed .
it was blazoned all over the media that the community was misspending or losing - of course , the word ' fraud ' cropped up time and time again - 4 % of our budget .
we have to take that on board and we have to decide whether we can give discharge to the commission in the light of what was said in the das statement .
let us just look at it .
the one thing that we have to remember is that discharge is the legal certification of the accounts .
when we look at this 4 % we have to ask the question : well , is this an acceptable level or a non-acceptable level ?
the simple answer is that it is a non-acceptable level !
parliament in no way can condone this 4 % figure .
so we cannot accept that one ecu in every 25 is wrongly paid .
but then you have to look at the system itself and you have to ask questions such as : is the figure reliable ?
that depends on which angle you look at it from !
you will find that discussed in the explanatory statement , where we ask whether the figure is reliable .
but if it is reliable , then whose fault is it ?
that is an even bigger dilemma .
in the main , we could blame the member states , because they are the ones who spend this 80 % of the budget .
but , of course , as i said , we do not give discharge to the member states .
the thing we should asking is : can those errors be corrected ?
let us be perfectly clear that parliament cannot legally establish a debt .
we cannot do the job of the commission .
therefore , we cannot make the recovery of the money a condition of discharge .
that is of fundamental importance .
parliament 's discharge power is focussed on the community 's accounts .
this is the area where , of course , we can act .
if the accounts were amended , as we request in paragraph 8 , to include the sums the commission hopes to recover , then three things would happen .
therefore , the conclusions reached in that general report are that we should grant discharge subject to these demands on the commission .
i now turn to the european development fund .
here the recommendation is greatly different .
there comes a time when we have to say enough is enough .
quite frankly , there are three things that have come to a head and which have now brought us to the stage where we say enough is enough .
we have said for a long time that the edf does not give the correct democratic accountability and that it is compromised by its legal and financial framework .
within this report and within the resolution parliament recognizes the commission 's attempt to improve the edf through its better financial management , even working within what we consider to be an impossible framework .
there is no criticism of the commission on the edf in general .
but the das gave us the opportunity to look at the accounts , and the court of auditors said that the accounts imperfectly reflect the financial situation and the operations of the edfs .
they lack the consistency and discipline to be able to reflect the true situation faithfully .
that is clearly not a positive statement of assurance .
dg viii of the commission would argue that it is .
that was once again our dilemma where we acted as the referee and in doing so the one thing we are clear about is that it is not a positive statement .
as i said about the general budget , it is there as a tool to help parliament .
it is member state expenditure which is managed by the commission .
in other words , the commission acts as a sub-contractor to manage these funds and to all intents and purposes parliament has no say in this expenditure .
yet we are obliged to give discharge .
we respect the court of justice ruling but it creates a confused and incoherent mess .
it also creates problems for the day-to-day management of the edfs .
if we want to give a discharge year in and year out , we would want to know where we stand legally to do so .
the commission has made great strides to change things and we accept that and welcome it .
that is the only way the system can change .
we also recognize with the current system that the commission staff in brussels is not sufficient , not in quality but in numbers .
it does not have enough staff to do what it should be doing at present .
the nature of the commission 's role as regards development funding gives rise to contradictions that parliament as a democratic institution finds extremely hard to accept .
member states take the credit for providing the funds .
they write the rule book - such as it is - but they then leave the commission and parliament to take the blame .
so there are two aspects which i have named so far .
firstly. the das and , secondly , the court of justice ruling .
the third aspect was what happened at the cultural foundation .
there should be no excuses whatsoever from the commission .
when i met the commission it would have been nice for them to have said : ' it 's a fair cop , guv ' nor .
we hold our hands up , we were wrong ' .
but a defence was put up in certain quarters and i find that quite inexplicable .
when something is as bad as what happened with the cultural foundation , we should not try to cover it up .
the commission took a political decision which it did not have to do even if the council of ministers was leaning upon it to do so .
in no way , shape or form should parliament be connected with that decision .
if we had not had the das or the court of justice ruling , i for one would have been recommending that we do not give discharge because of what happened with the cultural foundation .
from now on we have to look at it through different eyes and for the year 1994 the recommendation is refusal of discharge .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as a parliament we have a different task from that of the court of auditors .
our task is to make a political assessment of what the budget reveals about policy .
in the area of social policy , it reveals a gulf between the requirements , in terms of european social policy , and the european social policy that exists .
that comes across very clearly .
it is then further reflected in individual structural problems .
if we grant a discharge , we must recognize , on the one hand , that although european social policy is needed , it is not being practised .
however , we must also ask ourselves - and i would explicitly endorse what mr wynn said on this point - who is responsible in each instance .
if we cannot manage to curb this behaviour on the part of the member states , there is something strange about criticizing the commission and refusing to grant it discharge .
we must , therefore , grant discharge to the commission , because we have succeeded in establishing to our satisfaction that it is not the commission that is at fault here .
mr president , it is our job to monitor the efficiency of development aid and to exercise control , in our own political interest and the interest of the taxpayer .
it is perhaps worth noting that all this aid would not be needed if we had a fair system of trade , and were prepared to cancel debts .
in many cases , there are no written reports on these matters .
the commission should not rely too heavily on the implementing authorities or firms to provide effective monitoring .
this problem with the cultural foundation is a scandal , but it is already two years old .
we in parliament have brought the scandal to light , and set the wheels in motion to have it discussed .
i think we can fairly say that it is being dealt with .
if we do not grant this discharge , we may spark off a fresh debate about lom&eacute; iv and financing .
we have just been involved in major controversy with the council about these issues .
i find a great deal to criticize in lom&eacute; iv too , but we are talking here about the only forum for north-south dialogue .
this political dialogue has to be important to us .
therefore , we should not see it destroyed because of this one instance .
it is important that this issue should be discussed at the intergovernmental conference .
we must make the inclusion of the development fund in the budget a political issue at the conference .
that is our demand .
we should use this budget discharge as an occasion to exert pressure on the national governments .
mr wolf has just said that we must place a share of the responsibility on the national governments .
that is what we must do .
it is my belief that if we proceed by making an example of this scandal , the effect we produce will be disproportionate to our analysis .
that means that the fund must be budgetized .
it might then be possible to resolve scandals and problems such as these by other means .
mr president , i would like , first of all , to congratulate all the rapporteurs on these many reports and say that in each case i will be following the rapporteur 's recommendation .
it reflects the work they have done to get consensus for their reports .
i want to use my limited time to talk politically about the process that we are going through .
the commission 's attitude is welcome .
quite clearly the culture in the commission has changed and is improving .
i hope it will continue to improve until we have the sort of culture that has been visualized both by the president of the commission and in the sound and efficient management documents that have been put before us .
when i turn to the council i have to say that its attitude in the process is deplorable .
80 % of the expenditure is spent in the member states .
the fiddles that affect the european taxpayer largely take place in the member states and under their jurisdiction .
the clearance of accounts is in the member states .
the fines are then against the member states .
i could just as easily cite the other member states ; i am only choosing italy because i know it will be close to the president-in-office of the council .
other member states such as spain , greece , ireland and the united kingdom , have all been fined in the clearance of accounts procedures .
yet this council , which is long on rhetoric when it comes to value for money and the fight against fraud , is short on action .
the action of the council has been to send a civil servant to the committee who could not answer a single political question and to absent itself from our debate today .
granted it is absent to be at a trialogue , but they were the people who double-booked the meeting !
it is a contempt of parliament .
we might just as well have had a debate with an empty chair .
that has been the level of the contribution that the council has made to our procedures .
mr president , first of all i should like to associate myself with what mr tomlinson has just said .
however , we can already see growing signs that the court lacks the material resources to achieve the objectives which parliament itself has laid down .
and the requirement under the maastricht treaty to prepare a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts will contribute still more to putting pressure on certain material resources which are already very tight .
however , i think that the majority of this assembly would not approve such an application of the principle of subsidiarity .
but it is clear that more effective machinery for cooperation between the court of auditors and national audit departments must be set up .
all that comes from different constitutional systems which make it very difficult - though not impossible - to establish indispensable machinery for collaboration to ensure that community resources are satisfactorily controlled .
the commitment and political will of the members of this assembly to strengthen the material capacity of the court of auditors to perform its duties must be very clear .
i should like to end by congratulating all the rapporteurs whose capacity and readiness for discussion are shown by the small number of amendments tabled .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on the discharge for 1994 is proving of to be of greater importance than in the past .
in particular , we must ensure that there is greater transparency and publicity , particularly as regards the administration of direct funding , in certain vital sectors such as tourism and , more generally , internal policies .
we shall have , if necessary , to look into the possibility of setting up a committee of inquiry into the protection of the community 's financial interests .
mr president , i would like to start off by commending mr wynn for his discharge report on the general budget .
i believe that the rapporteur has succeeded in putting his finger right on the sensitive points which need to be highlighted .
i agree that a change has taken place recently .
co-operation with the commission is now conducted in a more positive spirit than hitherto .
i believe , however , that it is depressing to note that there are so many repetitions in the discharge reports , year after year .
we must impose a requirement that if the regulations are not observed , aid will be reduced , so that there are also consequences in this area for failure to comply with the applicable rules .
it is imperative that the purpose of the aid which we provide through the phare programme is to pave the way for enlargement with the eastern and central european countries .
however , the very fact of discussing these deficiencies openly and frankly can go some way towards generating confidence .
nothing should be swept under the carpet .
in this respect , all the reports paint a very clear picture and have the support of my group .
as i see it , there are two main areas of difficulty .
we must cut the ground from under the opportunists .
what do i meant by that ?
my colleague mr samland , and of course the council , will have more to say on this point .
if the rules on the administration of the structural funds are not observed , and if this does not incur , for example , the suspension of further payments , then such an approach is actually being encouraged .
it is a fact that 80 % of the eu budget is spent by the member states , and it is precisely there that significant deficiencies are emerging .
however , we shall get nowhere simply by issuing appeals .
as long as the eu budget functions with the present high level of subsidies from the agricultural and structural funds , there must be a range of sanctions mechanisms to prevent irregularities going unpunished .
the commission should therefore take very seriously all the proposals made by the committee on budgetary control for securing and recovering sums wrongly disbursed .
as regards external policy , the important thing is to overcome difficulties in the treaties , in order to achieve a more transparent spending policy and genuine cooperation between the two arms of the budgetary authority .
that applies equally to the european development fund and to the common foreign and security policy .
parliament has repeatedly called for the edf to be integrated into the budget .
the reasons for taking such a step are obvious , and led the court of auditors to comment that it was hard to draw any comparison between what was intended and what was implemented .
i would therefore say to all those who argue that a refusal to grant discharge would be an insult to development policy in general and our commitments under the lom&eacute; convention in particular : it is quite the opposite !
the financial subculture that we are currently sustaining is creating major administrative weaknesses .
we are meant to grant discharge , even though we have no influence or effective political control over how the resources are spent .
that has to change , not least in order to improve the quality of our development policy !
refusing discharge will , therefore , send the right signal to the intergovernmental conference , to tell them that it is time they came up with an institutional solution to this dilemma .
i also expect the conference on the revision of the treaty to produce clarification of the common foreign and security policy and associated budgetary matters .
there is a major procedural loophole , and unfortunately it now also affects discharge , because at the end of the day , parliament cannot discharge the council .
with regard to mrs kjer hansen , it was very clear that where there are corrections to be made , this should not be a political , negotiable matter .
it should be an objective matter based on the actual loss .
i follow mr cornelissen 's report on this point .
he explained that the money was not recovered because no member state had applied to the court .
this really will not do .
we have to get a new and better system that will work because they will find it inexplicable otherwise .
there is room for improvement .
to come to mr wynn 's general discharge , he says that he is recommending a discharge on assurances by the commission .
it is a bit difficult to know how we will vote because the commission has not been here to hear him and to give these assurances .
so what are they worth ?
we will not know , unless it reads the transcript tonight .
the council is here now but it did not hear either .
it is a very unsatisfactory situation .
i will have to explain that to my group at tonight 's meeting .
i am very critical of the member states .
they are dealing here with the european taxpayers ' money .
they do not seem to take it seriously enough .
we should not be giving the fig leaf of respectability that was mentioned by getting involved in a procedure where we really cannot act properly because we do not have proper control .
if i could have that assurance i could advise my group .
if it does not make any financial difference , if it does not destroy their confidence , then i could go along with the refusal to discharge .
but i would quite like to hear about that .
mr president , representative of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin with a comment on procedure .
i should like to point out that we are discussing eight reports in under three hours .
one of these concerns action to be taken following the 1992 discharge , namely mr cornelissen 's report .
on this subject , you will remember the discussions on the discharge in question , which was postponed for more than a year .
the second of these reports concerns action to be taken following the 1993 discharge .
is this reasonable ?
should not more time have been allowed for each of these reports ?
but do you know what this foundation 's budget is ?
i say this for the benefit of those who listen to us here : ecu 810 , 000 or 0.04 % of the edf .
i tabled an amendment which simply specified these amounts .
without being contested , this amendment was rejected .
why ?
in truth it was because the decision on discharge had been made in advance .
the arguments put forward are no more than pretexts .
discharge to the commission was refused because the edf is not integrated into the community budget .
so i should like to ask a few questions .
why was discharge granted at the time of previous edf budgets when similar criticisms had been raised and the legal framework was the same ?
have we taken into account the disastrous consequences , in political terms , of this refusal to grant discharge on the conference of acp countries , in terms of the way they perceive the commitment of the european countries ?
before requesting additional competences for parliament , would it not be better to ensure that there are more deputies able to implement them ?
mr president-inoffice , commissioner , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am very sorry that i am only now able to take part in this debate .
as you know , i do not make a habit of being late , because part of debating is , of course , being able to respond to what one 's colleagues have said .
i am exceptionally sorry about this , and it certainly does not mean that we underestimated the importance of this debate , but it does explain why we could not be here on time .
it has to be said , mrs m&uuml;ller , that there are certain points where one has the feeling that it should have been possible , somewhere between 1991 and 1996 , to achieve some movement .
a look at the tobacco regulation or the regulations in the wine sector , however , forces one to the conclusion that even five years is not long enough to see progress .
let me say something more on these four points , and firstly on tobacco .
we have a report before us from the court of auditors on this issue .
we asked the commission to submit a report on it , a report which was to be based on the court of auditors ' guidelines and submitted by 1 april .
the same applies to the wine sector , which is a virtual disaster .
we insisted that a register should be compiled - properly compiled in every member state .
now a new register is to be set up because the first procedure posed too many problems .
however , we are still paying for the current procedure and , of course , the new procedure is not available yet .
whose fault is it that the reform proposals have not been properly implemented ?
as in the previous case i referred to , the culprit is the council .
furthermore , the council has some 256 decisions pending , whereas here in parliament we have only 52 decisions in the pipeline .
that shows where the bottleneck and the imbalance between the institutions is to be found .
the third point concerns interest for the structural funds .
last but not least , transfers of appropriations by dg xix .
the committee on budgetary control has unanimously approved my draft report on this issue .
i am here to present the council recommendation , adopted on 11 march and transmitted to the house , that the commission be granted discharge for the budget for the 1994 financial year .
i am sure that you share the view of the presidency and the council that the two institutions need to work in harmony , including when it comes to measures concerning the community budget .
firstly : the decisions should reflect the needs of communities ; secondly : the resources should be used economically and efficiently ; and , thirdly , there should be complete transparency in resource management and accounting .
those criteria assume crucial importance at the current time when the member states are having to contend with well-known social and financial problems .
in its recommendation , the council emphasizes that budgetary discipline and respect for the principles of sound management , to which i referred , have to be applied to all measures funded from community resources .
it is vital that there should be a period review of the reasons that led to the adoption of the measures under way in order to guarantee economy and efficiency in resource utilization .
that should always be done independently of the assessments made to prepare budgetary decisions .
the reports of the court of auditors and the monitoring activities on which they are based provide the basic instruments that permit us to monitor the application of those principles .
we have to congratulate the court of auditors for the efficient way in which it performs this task assigned to it by the treaties .
in the field of own resources , the council shares the concerns of the court of auditors about the operation of the community transit scheme in the member states .
in that connection , it is most certainly interested in the european parliament 's suggestion that a temporary committee of inquiry be set up to look into these customs arrangements .
moving on to the structural funds , the council notes the persisting and major problem of an excessive concentration of commitments and payments towards the end of the financial year .
the council considers it necessary to improve cooperation between the competent national authorities and the commission services involved in spending activities .
we need also to make a greater effort to clarify the criteria governing the admissibility of expenditure and the verification of declarations of expenditure .
the council has pointed out that the accounts accurately reflect the revenue and expenditure of the union , even though the information they contain needs to be improved .
that has been at the root of the council 's concern , and it has welcomed the announcement of the programme to improve the commission 's financial management .
that programme must be applied rapidly and in full to reduce errors in payment transactions .
that is what the presidency had to say , on behalf of the council , on the problems relating to the 1994 budget .
mr president , i may have misheard what was said .
the council referred to the european regional development fund , but it did not take a position on the european development fund .
mr wynn warned that the discharge would be suspended .
the house would appreciate a response to what we have advocated , so that then we know where we stand .
we also have to form an opinion on these matters within our group .
the council cannot simply sweep its problems under the carpet now , because the scandal has made them quite apparent .
i should like a response from the council on this question .
does the council wish to speak again or wait until a later occasion ?
i prefer to wait , mr president .
mr president , as spokesperson for the socialist group on development , i deplore the fact that the management of the european development fund is not democratically accountable .
i deplore the fact that we go through this annual pretence , this annual charade , when parliament has no say whatsoever over the funding of the edf .
i deplore the disgrace of the management of the cultural foundation .
it was a scandal which was investigated by the bureau of the joint assembly of the lom&eacute; convention of which i was a member .
we called witnesses and carpeted individuals , including a key member of the european parliament .
i make that specific point to be fair to the commission .
cultural cooperation is central to development and has suffered a big setback because of this scandal .
i trust that the refusal to grant discharge will speed up the move towards the democratic accountability of the edf .
i wish to put on record that this parliament formally deplores the disgusting scandal of the cultural foundation .
i express the view that the commission should be vigilant and meticulous in supporting these views , about which i believe both the commission and parliament are in full agreement .
will the council now please as a matter of urgency exercise its responsibility to ensure that the funds of the edf are properly accountable .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , eight discharge reports have been presented , not quite in the order indicated on the agenda , but we appreciate the reasons for that .
it is impossible to speak on them all in four minutes .
i wish to look at only a few key points , but i should like to extend my sincere thanks to all the rapporteurs .
i shall begin with a word about the authority to grant discharge itself , and about our committee on budgetary control .
for 20 years now , we have had the authority to grant discharge , and we have constantly been developing it .
he performed his task well in so far as he could .
now you , mr president-in-office , have addressed the house , and i think you have also listened carefully to what has been said here .
our comments have been directed mainly at the member states , but it is not the member states to whom we must grant discharge .
i should like to turn now to the issues involved .
this time , the discharge of the commission involves two instruments which have been used for the first time - instruments , as i said , directed specifically at the member states .
the first innovation is our vote on the clearance of accounts for the eaggf , submitted by the commission for 1991 .
clearance of accounts was previously classed as a technical procedure for which the commission was responsible .
parliament had little to do with it .
it is thanks to mr cornelissen , as rapporteur on the 1992 discharge , that the problems from previous years have been raised .
a particular problem which has been brought out into the open is the loss to the community of some ecu 1.6 billion on milk quotas in three member states .
detailed discussions between the committee on budgetary control and the commission have produced reform as regards the clearance of accounts decision , which now completes the discharge already granted for the year in question .
this procedure is being applied for the first time for the year 1991 , with the very good report by mrs kjer hansen .
the rapporteur deserves our thanks for highlighting the difference between the technical and political aspects .
the necessary financial corrections applied by the commission to the member states are absolutely non-negotiable where losses to eu funds are involved .
if this is not the case , then the discharge for the clearance of accounts will have to be suspended until the monies are recovered .
an initial tangible result of parliament 's insistence on protecting taxpayers ' money is that the first tranche of the unpaid milk quotas has been received .
the second innovation , the statement of assurance , or das , by the court of auditors , has far-reaching implications as regards discharge .
the rapporteur , mr wynn , has done this in the motion for a resolution from the committee on budgetary control , and his readable explanatory statement provides us all with an invaluable aid to understanding this complex issue .
i would like to thank him particularly for that .
my group therefore backs the recommendation to grant discharge to the commission in respect of the general budget for 1994 , in spite of the shortcomings that have been identified , and subject to the appropriate conditions .
madam president , it is appropriate that in discussing budgetary matters we make some reference to the key principles governing responsible budgetary control , such as prudence and the allocation of funding to appropriate and deserving projects .
however , it is clear that not all european projects adhere to these principles and i wish to refer to one in particular .
i am speaking about the administration of our own finances within our own structures .
recent visitors to brussels were taken aback by the continuing construction of the european parliament 's new headquarters there , which has been going on since 1990 , and the ornate nature of the building in question .
this latter-day glass tower of babel is utterly unnecessary and a waste of resources which parliament could have more constructively utilized for other aspects of its work .
all these ecu saved are now being heedlessly squandered .
meps , who have a democratic mandate from the electorate , were not consulted on the building of this folly or allowed any opportunity to veto its construction .
instead , the building of this glass palace has continued unimpeded .
it is particularly ironic that we are discussing budgetary and fiscal matters today in this parliament .
if ever there was an example of budgetary irresponsibility , it is the grandiose edifice currently taking shape in brussels .
perception is very important in this european parliament and this is no help to it .
madam president , i have a number of comments on the wynn report on the discharge for the 1994 financial year .
first of all , what he says about agriculture .
i think that in future it will be almost impossible to forecast agricultural expenditure with any accuracy .
so i think it is always better to err on the side of caution , so that we are always able to honour the guarantees we give our farmers .
one aspect over which we do have control is to make the rules as clear as possible , but as many people have already pointed out , they still leave a lot to be desired .
if a political decision is to be taken on how the rules are to be revised , i think it should be a matter for the commission , the council and parliament together .
my second comment concerns the phare programme .
could we not bring officials from the agriculture ministries in the countries of the former eastern bloc over to brussels , and send dg vi people to those countries to explain its policy ?
it is doing practically nothing to implement directives on public contracts or the environment .
the reason for this is clear : if it did so , the structural funds would end up being even more seriously underspent than at present .
i find it hard to believe that the 50 % profit all goes to the contractors .
the situation with the environment is no better .
the main reason for this , as i have said before , is that most of the commissioners regard it as far more important to spend the budget than to respect legislation .
i entirely agree with what mr liikanen said in a letter concerning community customs , that the commission has no choice but to carry on enforcing existing legislation .
that is just as it should be .
but in my experience , it is not what the commission actually does .
madam president , my colleague from my constituency , mr killilea , was at his colourful best when he described the new european parliament as the tower of babel .
i am sure it is designed to attract the maximum attention , but i do not want that sort of allegation circulating in my constituency unanswered .
we did not build a parliament for the members of parliament who are here today .
we built it for the people of europe .
it was built at a cost of about ecu 3 per capita for one year of the people of this european union .
i am proud of that building .
it reflects some of the technology and the grandeur of the age and the competence of the people of europe of this day .
the attack by mr killilea was not worthy of a member of parliament .
if he had attended regularly to the business of this house he would have known that we were consulted .
if he was not prepared to be here at all times then he could trust his colleagues who were here and made the decisions .
i want to thank mr wynn for his report .
i support his refusal of discharge .
i am not looking at it in the area of the european development fund .
i do not agree with the tone of his criticism in relation to agricultural spending .
the expertise and the knowledge that i find in the commission surprises me at times .
it is a most infinitely complicated business to try to forecast what the cost of agriculture will be for any year .
parliament is continuously a little bit harsh insofar as this sort of criticism is concerned .
the last point i want to make is in relation to the fine that was imposed on the irish government .
unfortunately the irish taxpayers have to accept this while they got no benefit out of malpractices which led to it .
i want to underline the fact that it was not at european level but within the irish parliament that the first disclosures and demand for clarification on all these abuses occurred .
this fine was exceptionally harsh in that it was equivalent to ecu 1 , 000 million for the british or the italians .
irish agriculture got no benefit out of it whatever .
madam president , i will refer to the report by our esteemed colleague mr edward kellett-bowman on postponement of the discharge to the management board of the european centre for the development of vocational training in thessaloniki .
frankly , i did not understand why mr kellett-bowman is asking for postponement .
is he doing so because there was a financial scandal in the management up till 1994 ?
if so , he should say so in his report , he should describe it to us , and i believe we would then all go along with him .
however , his report mentions no such thing .
on the contrary , it expresses doubts about the continuation of that centre 's operation - cedefop 's operation - related to its productivity and efficacy .
those who had powerful political protectors were transferred to other services of the european union .
those who were close to pensionable age requested early retirement , which they were granted , and finally , those who did not fit either of these categories resigned .
so of approximately 100 people , less than half are now in thessaloniki .
and i , ladies and gentlemen , would like to ask : is that how europe 's enlargement will take place ?
when the eastern countries accede in due course , will certain spoiled members of staff refuse to transfer to capitals outside the parisberlin-brussels triangle ?
is that the basis for the european parliament 's policies on decentralization and regional development ?
i am very sorry , but unless i get serious answers to the questions i have raised , my recommendation to my group will be to vote against mr kellettbowman 's report .
madam president , i wish to speak with reference to mr blak 's report on the ecsc on the discharge for 1994 .
i would like to draw members ' attention to paragraph 11 in mr blak 's report that is on the uk pit closures .
can we look very briefly at the wording of mr blak 's report ?
it says , very interestingly , it accepts that the ecsc will not be able to recover by legal means the interest rate subsidies paid to financial production enhancing investment .
but if it cannot be returned by legal means , is mr blak , or is the commission , going to send the boys round to 10 downing street to ask for the money back ?
what is at stake here ?
the court of auditors ' report says quite clearly that under article 54 , 15 pits received subsidies .
two of them were closed .
one - lea hall in my constituency - has received an unrecoverable subsidy of almost half-a-million ecu and frickley colliery a subsidy of ecu 294 million , which has not been recovered from the british government .
monies have also been paid to pits which were subsequently privatized - two , again , in my constituency : trentham and silverdale .
i know that when trentham was privatized , much of the equipment paid for by the ecsc was actually bricked-up .
how are you going to get that money back for us and stop it happening again ?
the question of the staffing of uclaf is similarly important .
this means that it must also be given the level of staffing that it requires .
this has demonstrated the importance of checks and the need to extend their scope significantly , so that the member states , too , can be made aware of their own responsibility .
the final issue that i wish to highlight concerns the satellite bodies , the decentralized institutions which are based in individual member states , but work for the union as a whole .
our greek colleague has referred to the centre for the development of vocational training .
as a result of its move to thessaloniki , this centre is experiencing difficulties .
mr kellett-bowman and the committee were right to recommend that we should defer discharge until this body acquires a clear function and provides a quality of service commensurate with the need .
we shall see whether this is to be the case .
if so , the centre will have a purpose .
if not , we must draw the necessary conclusions .
madam president , the debate on discharge for the european budget clearly throws up one important reason for the disenchantment with europe that we see in our countries .
one of the causes of disenchantment is the somewhat lax approach to money - european taxpayers ' money .
i have been following the debate today with interest , because it has focused quite clearly on the question of finding a culprit : was it the member states , or was it the commission ?
i see this as a rather fruitless line of inquiry .
the european parliament is being shuttled here from pillar to post .
i cannot entirely absolve the commission from blame .
through its refusal , parliament will let it be known that we are no longer prepared to cover for goings-on which deserve to be highlighted , rather than concealed .
it is clear that irregularities , such as that involving the cultural foundation , occur in areas where the responsibilities are ill defined .
to put it plainly , it is our wish and our demand that the european development fund should become part of the european budget , so as to remove the grounds for mismanagement in this area .
i hope that the new member states , too , will have some pertinent suggestions .
however , i think that we are also entitled to expect active support from the commission .
i think this is extremely questionable .
indeed , it has to be asked whether the commission takes the whole business seriously enough , and i would simply remind you of how the debate opened .
i was not made sufficiently aware today of the way in which the council and the member states are involved in this whole process .
i also think that in many cases , the commission 's attitude to member states which step out of line , by failing to observe the conditions , is half-hearted .
in any event , i have no hesitation at all in supporting the proposal to defer or even refuse discharge in the case of cedefop , but this situation cannot go on indefinitely .
i already see reason enough to ask whether we should not be thinking in terms of closure .
contrary to the view of one of the previous speakers , mr kellett-bowman made it very clear that there is no assurance at all that this centre is performing its functions efficiently .
in conclusion , i should simply like to make a point which i think has been neglected this year - that just as we have been looking at expenditure , we must also consider revenue .
we referred to the fact that this task is being undertaken in the committee of inquiry .
however , the committee reflects only some of the major concerns in this area which we need to discuss .
madam president , at the outset , i must state that i have particular reservations about mr kellett-bowman 's report on cedefop .
the report refers to minor financial management problems , which lead it to conclude that cedefop 's discharge concerning the financial year 1994 must be postponed .
the proposal to postpone discharge is based on a report by external consultants , which is unclear about the extent to which it refers to the financial year 1994 .
i suspect that other aims and aspirations lie behind this attitude , such as restricting cedefop 's activities and closing it down , as the report indirectly implies .
yet , it was a policy decision that we all ought to respect and support .
the utility of cedefop is enormous at a time when unemployment is one of the european economy 's gravest problems .
madam president , i think the european commission has an obligation to make better use of cedefop 's contribution , as the rapporteur himself also said .
besides , a long-term programme prepared by cedefop has already been prepared , and this must be given serious attention .
finally , i would like to invite the rapporteur , when he visits thessaloniki , to assess the situation objectively .
for the present , i call on the rapporteur to delete paragraph 2 of the motion for a resolution , which casts doubt upon cedefop 's utility .
it must be said that this is only the tip of the iceberg .
i believe that it is the role of this commission and of this council to monitor and control the use of those funds and to take action .
i am afraid it is simply not good enough to say that , for legal reasons , the commission cannot act to recover taxpayers ' money .
it simply will not wash with the public and they will see the hypocrisy of our policies .
therefore , i ask the commission and the council to take action .
two years ago i tabled parliamentary questions on this matter .
as yet we have had no results on that .
madam president , i wish to refer to mr samland 's report , on which i congratulate him .
i welcome in particular his reference to the tacis programme and the greater need for commitment to the monitoring of tacis projects .
there is also a need , as the rapporteur stated , for a better dissemination of the results of the tacis programme .
tacis has poured some &pound; 600 million into the russian federation , for example , in the last five years .
yet does parliament have a clear idea of where the money has been spent or how effective tacis has been ?
the answer must be a resounding no !
increased accountability and transparency must be given top priority , including increased monitoring of programme spending for the newly-independent states of the former soviet union .
but this must not be at the expense of swift and efficient implementation .
i should like to apologise for the delay at the beginning but we were spending time together with members of the committee on budgets and presidency trying to solve the problems of next year 's budgetary procedure .
the debate today and the vote tomorrow bring to a close the review of the financial activities of the community in 1994 .
the process of external control is a key part of the efforts to improve the effectiveness and the value for money of the community budgets .
each step - from the reports of the court of auditors to the thorough deliberations of the european parliament - reinforces the efforts for financial management reform in the commission and across the community .
the committee on budgetary control , based on a report by mr wynn , recommends giving discharge to the commission with regard to the general community budget for 1994 .
discharge is also proposed concerning the european coal and steel community and the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions in dublin , based on the reports of mr blak and mr kellett-bowman , respectively .
the commission welcomes these proposals .
in this context i want to reply to mr blak on the question of bagnoli , italy .
the subsidy was fully paid back by the end of the last year .
the discharge for the cedefop is postponed .
the commission will work with the rapporteur , mr kellett-bowman , to clarify the outstanding issues .
finally , with regard to the european development fund , based on a report by mr wynn , it is proposed to reject the discharge .
i will return to this question in a moment .
the particularity of the 1994 discharge procedure is that it has to evaluate the results of a new instrument introduced by the maastricht treaty , the ' statement of assurance ( das ) ' .
at the same time , the necessity to come to general conclusions on the basis of a small sample poses difficult methodological questions .
there is also the difficulty of explaining the meaning of the results to a broader public .
as has already been said today , the headlines of : ' billion ecu fraud and waste ' - unfounded as they were - show the difficulty of a broader public to comprehend this instrument .
it is therefore particularly valuable that the comprehensive and balanced assessment of the first das by mr wynn will establish a reference for future exercises .
i want to congratulate the commission and mr wynn for their excellent work .
i especially want to refer to the explanatory note because it is conceptually a very difficult issue and it is very clearly explained in the note .
this might even prove to be a useful reference for the commission in the future .
the commission will continue to work with the court of auditors and outside experts to improve the methodology of das .
the main consequences to be drawn from the first das are twofold .
firstly , all efforts will continue to eliminate sources of errors identified in das .
the errors attributed to the commission - mainly formal - have been addressed as part of the first two stages of the sound and efficient management programme ( sem 2000 ) .
the errors attributed to the member states - often substantial - will be addressed in the third stage of the exercise .
this stage has been launched .
the first meeting of the group of personal representatives of the ministers of finance of 7 march 1996 was fruitful .
a work programme was agreed .
it covers topics from the preparation of the budget to financial control .
the first items discussed in some depth included the question of eligibility of structural funds expenditure and the possibility of reinforced sanctions .
these questions are identified by the 1994 discharge report as the key question for the structural funds .
as mr samland said in his report , this is a key issue .
we hope that in the working group we are going to find a solution .
the discussions in the group of personal representatives confirmed expectations that progress on the questions will be difficult .
a number of member states took a view opposite to the approach of the court of auditors and the european parliament .
there is , in fact , a built-in contradiction between , on the one hand , ambitious quality objectives and , on the other hand , the political commitment to ' spend it all ' by 1999 .
the european council of madrid has given a strong impetus to increasing quality of spending and examining the possibility of new sanctions .
but the basic contradiction remains .
the commission will therefore - from now on - provide a report on the follow-up of each serious payment error .
this report will be made available jointly with the annual financial accounts .
furthermore , the claims forecasts ( or pr&eacute;visions de cr&eacute;ances ) will from now on be established by sector .
the amounts will be estimated by the commission services concerned regardless of the source of information which establishes an irregularity .
the recovery will then be pursued according to the sectional procedures in place .
in different sectors we have different procedures .
as far as internal policies are concerned , the 1994 discharge report expresses serious doubts on the transparency of procedures with regard to direct financing and subsidies .
there is little evidence to support this view in the report of the court of auditors .
in fact , it should be noted that both life and research expenditure have their specific , detailed rules assuring transparency with regard to project selection and programme evaluation .
publication in the official journal is mandatory .
tourism activities have been thoroughly evaluated .
the results will be transmitted to parliament in a few weeks ' time .
i highly recommend reading this report as an informative approach to the evaluation methodology in which i strongly believe for the future .
the commission will work with parliament on any useful improvement .
instead of another horizontal report covering all of category 3 , it would however be more effective to focus on individual programmes through ex ante and ex post evaluations for each programme concerned .
let me turn then to the european development fund .
the committee on budgetary control proposes not to discharge the commission .
this proposal is not primarily based on bad management by the commission .
in fact mr wynn 's report recognizes the commission 's attempts to improve edf financial management although it criticizes the financial management of the acp cultural foundation .
instead the main reason is the non-budgetization of the edf .
the commission regrets this proposal .
for its part it will continue its best efforts to improve the administration of the edf .
the management mistakes made with regard to the cultural foundation are recognized but consequences have been drawn from this experience and the foundation has been shut down .
it should also be borne in mind that the amounts involved were quite small .
furthermore , the commission has always shared the criticism of parliament concerning the legal and financial framework of the edf .
the commission will continue to press for budgetization of the edf .
but to refuse discharge until the edf is budgetized , while being understandable and consistent , may mean that until such a time parliament 's voice will not exist with regard to the edf implementation .
finally , as you are certainly aware , there are those in the commission dealing with development policy who fear that the refusal of discharge may make development policy more difficult in future .
let me conclude with two replies to mrs kjer hansen and mr cornelissen , whom i also want to thank for their excellent reports .
mrs kjer hansen talked about the resources in the clearance of accounts .
we have known the needs there , but i want to say that the commission has already taken a decision for the 1997 budget that we will not ask new resources outside the enlargement budget .
so we will do all we can within the redeployment and the enlargement budgets .
mr cornelissen had a number of questions here .
first of all , concerning the recovery of the funds for exceeding the milk quotas , we are recovering the funds in four years which means in four equal tranches .
in 1995 we have already received ecu 450m ; ecu 450m has been decided for this year and budgetized and two other tranches will be recovered in 1997 and 1998 .
as far as tobacco fraud is concerned , investigations and legal proceedings continue .
the commission will keep parliament informed of any new developments .
as to the buy-back scheme of milk quotas , the legal base has in the meantime been adopted and the commission considers this matter closed .
on the spanish milk quota in 1989 the commission does not have a legal base to change the decision .
this is also the position of the court of justice .
finally , on the dutch calves i will transmit that question to commissioner fischler .
my expertise is not sufficient for that .
there was also a question on the ecsc loans to british coal .
we discussed this matter also a year ago .
i am sorry to say this but , according to the opinion of the legal service , there is no legal base for the commission to recover these subsidies on the grounds that british coal was subsequently closed .
finally , i want to extend thanks to mrs theato , the chairman of the committee on budgetary control for these exceptionally thorough and productive discharge procedures for 1994 .
mr president-in-office of the council , would you like to speak ?
madam president , a very brief comment concerning the european development fund .
i would point out that the fund is financed via direct contributions from the member states and not with appropriations from the community budget .
that being so , discharge of the fund budget was not mentioned in today 's speech by the presidency .
madam president , we must correct that statement if it is going to be in the record .
what came through in english was that parliament plays no part in discharge of the edf .
that is the whole point .
we play a part in that and in nothing else .
madam president , there is a very serious conflict here between the commission and council that we need to clarify .
the commission has alleged that unless we grant the discharge concerning the european development funds , it may make their work more difficult .
this was followed by a statement from the council informing us that we do not have any responsibility whatsoever to discharge the edf .
could they get their act together and tell us what the situation is ?
madam president , i am grateful to the council for the information it has just given us , but i would appreciate it if the accuracy of that information could be checked again .
as far as i am aware , it is not accurate .
there is definitely a recommendation from the council as regards the development fund .
i would therefore ask for this point to be checked again .
madam president , on this point i fully support what mrs theato has just said .
i should simply like to make the point , at the end of this debate , that there has been frequent mention of the respective presence of the institutions during the procedure .
commissioner liikanen was present to reply to the rapporteurs but four of the eight rapporteurs were absent .
we will take note of this .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 12 noon on wednesday .
question time ( commission )
the next item is question time to the commission ( b4-0431 / 96 ) .
the removal of controls on goods and baggage at internal frontiers does not flow from the schengen agreement .
further reductions in and the final abolition of such checks will depend on the gradual increase of travellers ' exemptions and on future developments in the rules applicable to travellers crossing borders ' .
it is , in particular , the community instruments , adopted to complete the internal market , that guarantee the removal of controls on goods and baggage at internal frontiers .
i posed this question because the opponents of cooperation under schengen always maintain that accession to schengen will make it more difficult to catch criminal gangs .
as the honourable member is aware , the commission is taking part in the meetings of the schengen executive committee as an observer .
the application of the schengen agreement has therefore stimulated cooperation in the field of activities of prevention and control applied by the competent authorities of the various member states .
i therefore believe that the response - of particular interest to those countries which are considering acceding to schengen in the future - may be encouraging .
mr president , i should like to take up the issue raised by mr haarder 's question .
at present the situation is that these controls are conducted on the basis of spot checks without the national customs authorities in denmark and sweden having to have any suspicions of criminal behaviour .
does the commissioner consider that such spot checks , not based on any suspicion of criminal behaviour , are compatible with the schengen agreement ?
it is sufficient that are not carried out automatically because the frontier is being crossed .
controls are in any case possible far from frontier zones and , on occasion , even at the frontier , but they have to be based on the assumption that the frontier has been crossed .
mr president , this surprises me a little as we have been told that it will no longer be allowed for sweden to carry out spot checks of the kind carried out before we acceded to the european union .
this question is therefore extremely important .
some change is surely bound to happen in connection with the schengen agreement ?
however , given that the crossing of internal frontiers can no longer form the basis for carrying out checks , the exercise of that power must form part of a system of controls covering the territory as a whole .
any power to carry out checks that is able to exercised solely where or because an internal frontier has been crossed would therefore be incompatible with article 7a .
as the author is not present , question no 19 lapses .
i apologize to commissioner flynn and to mr mcmahon who rushed to the chamber for this question .
question no 20 by brian crowley ( h-0240 / 96 )
subject : duty-free shopping
duty-free shopping at airports , on airlines and on car ferries is a voluntary activity on the part of travellers , the profits from which contribute significantly towards the viability of many airports , air and ferry routes .
in addition , the products sold in duty-free outlets throughout the world are dominated by brand names from european union companies whose competitiveness is assisted by duty-free sales during international travel within the european union .
that is the thirteenth recital of directive 91 / 680 .
the commission wishes to make it quite clear that in considering the issue of duty-free sales it has to be borne in mind that refraining from collecting taxes in specific sectors is in fact tantamount to granting aid .
it will therefore be difficult for the commission to consider extending the facilities for duty-free shops , as these are arrangements incompatible with the principles of the internal market .
i thank the commissioner for his response .
however , he is somewhat misguided in what he has said .
indeed he is throwing a very unusual veil of secrecy over what is going on .
he said that the duty-free mechanism is contrary to the internal market .
yet one of the major points of any internal market should be the harmonization of vat and excise duty ratings .
that is not happening .
there is no sign of it happening in the near future .
i will try to be brief although the matter is not particularly simple .
duty and tax-free sales to intra-community travellers at airports , on aircraft or on ferries have been authorized by the council until 30 june 1999 .
it should therefore no longer suffer distortions of competition from tax-free sales after the 30 june 1999 deadline , which is the end of the period of adaptation .
so the relevant event which logically produces the necessity for an end to the dutyfree system is not the future definitive vat regime but is something which has already been substantially in place since 1 january 1993 .
i should like to thank the commissioner for the observations he has made .
my own view is that it is a complex matter , as he has said .
it is probably too complex to deal with in this manner .
the commissioner has suggested that duty-free shopping , were it to continue beyond the deadline set by the council , would offend the principles of the internal market ; but it does not necessarily offend against the treaty .
the treaty provides in article 99 for harmonization necessary to ensure the establishment and functioning of the market .
i do not know that the case has yet been well established that the scale of alleged distortion is in some way a significant problem or impediment to the functioning of the internal market .
i should like to ask the commissioner one question .
on 20 november 1990 in a debate on the vat system in relation to the fuchs report your predecessor promised the house a full commission study on the implications of abolishing duty-free sales prior to the date in question .
this question gives me the opportunity to refer to the report .
that is the way it is in many places in europe .
a different transport pattern is produced when duty free sales are done away with in this manner .
finally , i have a question which does not need to be answered , because i realise that it is complex .
we might well ask what duty free sales actually mean : do they distort competition when all the member states take part ?
strictly speaking , they do not .
the last thing which i should perhaps mention is , that as this report is delayed in the commission , it indicates that the actual complexity of the matter just cannot be described in a report .
there are transport , social and regional conditions to be considered .
i hope , however , that we will be able to find a solution together .
the point about transparency is a relevant one .
it is true that the present duty-free system contributes to the financial resources of airports , ferries and so on .
that is what i have said from the beginning in saying that the present duty-free system contains an element of aid .
question no 21 by wayne david ( h-0229 / 96 )
subject : vat claims
what are the procedures involved in claiming back vat on goods and services purchased across the european continent by long-distance lorry drivers ?
the applicant has the right to use the pre-stamped form in any of the official languages of the european union , whereas the form itself must be completed in the language of the country making the refund .
although the commission is aware of the practical problems that these procedures may create for operators , it is not , unfortunately , possible to remedy them in the context of the current vat arrangements .
problems of that nature will , however , come to an end when we move on to the definitive vat regime , based on the principle of taxation in the country of origin .
