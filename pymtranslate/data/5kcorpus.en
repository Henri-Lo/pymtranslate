resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday , 28 march 1996 .
welcome
i bid you a warm welcome !
approval of the minutes
the minutes of the sitting of thursday , 28 march 1996 have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
points 16 and 17 now contradict one another whereas the voting showed otherwise .
i shall be passing on to you some comments which you could perhaps take up with regard to the voting .
i will have to look into that , mrs oomen-ruijten .
i cannot say anything at this stage .
we will consider the matter .
mr president , it concerns the speech made last week by mr fischler on bse and reported in the minutes .
perhaps the commission or you could clarify a point for me .
it would appear that a speech made at the weekend by mr fischler indicates a change of his position .
i welcome this change because he has said that he will eat british beef and that the ban was imposed specifically for economic and political reasons .
could somebody clarify that he has actually said this please , mr president , because it is a change of views .
mr sturdy , i cannot see what that has to do with the minutes .
mr president , on exactly the same point as mr sturdy has raised .
if commission fischler has made this statement , then he has said that it is not a matter of public health .
mr smith , the same applies to your point ; it has nothing to do with the minutes .
mr president , again on bse .
if mr fischler has changed his views does this mean the commission has ?
this was actually referred to in the minutes .
he said that any funding would also go towards supporting workers who had directly lost their jobs .
so far nothing has come of this in any scheme that has been put forward .
does this mean the commission has changed its view on supporting workers who have lost their jobs through this scare ?
i note that there are no comments on the minutes .
( parliament approved the minutes )
now that is clearly a fraud on the french taxpayer as well as a fraud on the european citizens .
can we ask the bureau to look into this fact .
can we ask you as president to make sure that is happening with the taxpayers ' money for which we are collectively responsible .
mr tomlinson , would you please give me the documents concerned .
then i will look into the matter , both in the presidency and with the other organizations in question .
you yourself know best how difficult and complicated the legal situation is between parliament and the firms contracted to build the hemicycle .
after all , we have in you an expert who is in any case closely concerned with these matters .
mr president , i should like to deal very briefly with two matters .
thank you !
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 11 april 1996 pursuant to rule 95 of the rules of procedure has been distributed .
no amendments have been proposed .
mr president , i should like to ask a question .
we were too late to hand it in , but it has been discussed with a number of members . it is the following .
i think that in view of present events in the middle east , we ought to ask whether the council can make a statement on wednesday afternoon about the way things are going .
we note that the situation is changing every day . we see that the french government has sent a mediator .
we hear nothing from the presidency . nor have we heard anything , unfortunately , from the commission .
that is reason enough for us to be put in the picture .
i should like to ask you to see whether it is possible for the italian presidency to do that on wednesday afternoon .
we recognize that the agenda is very full .
then we could deal with chernobyl some time later .
i offer that as a suggestion , mr president .
if you would like to arrange things some other way so that we do not need to take chernobyl off the agenda that would suit us just as well .
mr president , my group is certainly of the view that what is happening in the middle east is very significant and that we cannot let this week with parliament in full session pass without any response or discussion .
could we leave it to you , mr president , to see whether the council is prepared to make a statement on the middle east and what is happening in the lebanon ?
could we then look to you to see what is possible .
i am reluctant , as i know many of my colleagues are , to remove chernobyl from the agenda , as suggested by mrs oomen-ruijten .
however , it would be possible for us to come back to the issue of chernobyl which does not have such immediacy although it is the tenth anniversary .
we could take this in two weeks ' time , whereas the issue of lebanon is crucial at this moment .
perhaps , mr president , we could ask you to look at this with the council and see what would be possible .
mr president , i am glad to support mrs oomen-ruijten 's suggestion , supported by mrs green - with one slight reservation .
that is no problem for me ; i think it is a good initiative , but again europe is absent .
that was previously the case in the crisis between turkey and greece , and then mr holbrooke rightly said :
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i think it is important that we should discuss the situation in the middle east this week .
we all agree on that .
but i think it is equally important that we discuss chernobyl this week .
i cannot support this proposal .
the whole world is talking about the tenth anniversary .
a major conference was held in vienna .
there was a tribunal .
and then we say we will postpone it to whenever .
i really think it would show parliament in a poor light if we do not discuss it on wednesday .
there are various other options .
we can listen to the council on the subject on wednesday morning , but please not just in a week 's time .
at a time when the whole world is discussing chernobyl and the effects of that disaster , we in this parliament cannot say , we shall hold back and say nothing about it !
mr president , i have already given you the reasons why the council should make a statement about the bombardment of lebanon .
that would be a bad sign for the intergovernmental conference and for the future of the european union .
but i think , like mrs roth , that we cannot make the subject of chernobyl and the subject of the middle east compete in the ' free market for news items ' .
we must seek out the opportunity to discuss both subjects .
mr president , like previous colleagues , i believe it to be absolutely essential that the council make a statement on wednesday about the middle east situation , particularly in southern lebanon .
what is happening there is worrying and distressing because the whole peace process that has been under way for several months could be threatened .
we should also remember lebanon itself , which has been ravaged for many years , under the domination of one foreign power while part of its territory is occupied by another .
ladies and gentlemen , this is one of the cases where there is no satisfactory solution because someone is bound to be disappointed and any decision is bound to be to the detriment of someone 's interests .
let me describe the situation to you as i see it .
first , let me please establish whether the council is prepared and in a position to make a statement .
but it would be neither right nor a good idea to shorten that debate since the italian president-in-office of the council will be here on wednesday morning .
so the only possible compromise is to postpone the gonz&aacute;les &aacute;lvarez report and cut question time by half an hour .
i realise that to do so would be at the cost of members who have questions .
that is regrettable .
it is not that we will satisfy everybody this way , but if we are to try to find a solution , i am convinced that is the only possible one .
the order of business for this week is thus established .
energy efficiency
overall , this proposal is very vague and general and , sadly , contains no real topics or projects .
the legislative level has been disregarded entirely , although the evaluation of save i showed that 80 % of the successes of that programme were achieved by means of legislative measures .
many of the proposals for directives and action programmes planned by the commission have for some obscure reason never seen the light of day .
for instance , it has been estimated that the introduction of calorimeters would have yielded savings of approximately 4.75 million tonnes of crude oil units and a co2 reduction by the year 2010 of 12 million tonnes per year .
the savings from the introduction of an energy certificate for buildings would have been far higher than that even .
this list could be extended forever .
it is clear that whenever the practical will is not there , subsidiarity is brought up as an argument .
that is why the responsibility for achieving the efficiency target and at the same time reducing co2 lies with the community , which in fact takes action when an objective can be achieved more effectively by community measures .
strictly speaking , it is the credibility of the eu that is at stake here .
the commission and the council have constantly declared how vital it is to reduce co2 and to save energy .
the council has set objectives in a series of resolutions , for example in its resolutions of 16.9.86 and 29.10.90 and in the commitments it made in rio and berlin .
so far , however , there has been no more than grandiloquent announcements and reams of paper .
the commission itself estimates that the co2 emissions will rise by up to 8 % in the period from 1995 to 2000 .
so one may well ask : is the community actually taking its own practical declarations of intent and obligations towards its citizens , and towards the international community , seriously or is this just a theatre of the absurd ?
if it really is being serious , words must finally be followed by deeds .
we urgently need genuine measures to combat the greenhouse effect and increase energy efficiency .
the situation is too serious to allow for any further delay .
a beginning might be made with a genuinely ambitious save ii programme , as proposed by the committee on research , technological development and energy .
that is why the amendments tabled by that committee should quite definitely be adopted .
the objection that such programmes can only be disruptive given the current economic climate and unemployment level in many member states is unacceptable and merely ridiculous .
for in addition to their environmental dimension , they can also have a substantial positive impact on the economy .
according to the commission , apart from its effects on the quality of life , these savings would also have positive effects on employment .
let me repeat that i deeply regret that the committee did not accept my proposal that we extricate ourselves from this unholy cooperation procedure and aim at a co-decision procedure .
it would have been more sensible for parliament always to apply the co-decision procedure .
if we give the money we should also be able to say that we would like to see legislative measures .
for that is the decisive point here .
mr president , firstly i congratulate mrs bloch von blottnitz on the amazing feat of achieving consensus in the committee on research . technological development and energy .
i think she is well placed through her excellent report to achieve consensus in the plenary session of parliament .
energy efficiency is of fundamental importance both to the environmental and the competitiveness policies of the european union .
as far as the environment is concerned , we are a long way off meeting the targets which we set ourselves in rio .
we are suffering widespread climate instability because of that failure .
as far as competitiveness is concerned , we see a reprehensible and incredible waste of money throughout the european union ; billions and billions of ecus are being wasted in energy usage that is not necessary .
think of the purchasing power which those billions could release to our economy .
larger firms are , of course , aware of this .
our target through this programme has to be the smaller firms and individual households .
they must make the decisions which will allow us to save that energy and save that money .
if we look at the history we see very rapid action following the oil shock in 1973 .
since then , however , there has been major regression tempered only by the recession which has hit most of our countries .
the energy / intensity use in most of the european union is worsening .
that is unacceptable .
the save i programme was very small beer , a very small amount of money .
it is being evaluated , fortunately , before we move on to save ii .
one would have hoped the lessons from save i would be learnt .
that is not so , as i shall explain later on .
one of the lessons from save i was that far and away the best thing to do is to bring in binding legislation which member states have to enforce .
there were ambitious plans for legislation .
very little of that legislation has appeared .
it is true that we have legislation on the efficiency of boilers , fridges and freezers , labelling , and there is more to come .
but that is not enough .
we know that the main obstacle has been the predictable resistance of manufacturers .
they have no vested interest in energy efficiency and that is clear from their stance .
let us look at the lessons .
firstly , legislation is what works .
secondly , you must have targets and you must monitor them .
the target in save ii is not ambitious ; 1.5 % increase year-on-year is not ambitious .
i would like to see an indicative programme issued by the commission and monitored throughout the member states .
another lesson that is important , not from save i but from the regional programme , is that you must incorporate measures on energy efficiency into the regional work of the eu and its policies .
they help impoverished regions .
of course the same would apply to third countries .
i would like to see far more emphasis in our dealings with countries in central and eastern europe and the mediterranean areas on energy efficiency .
one area which must be emphasized above all is transport .
transport takes almost half the energy cost and it uses almost half the oil .
we have not done enough in that sector .
then there are domestic and industrial appliances , insulation for the heating of homes , and in some parts of the eu for the cooling of homes .
there is a good home rating scheme developed in my own constituency which should be far more widespread .
it must be made easier for third parties to finance energy-efficient measures and for the growing industry of energy services to be helped . this makes us competitive , remember .
combined heat and power is another very sensible measure which needs encouragement ; as do education and information throughout the eu , particularly to the target groups .
we need millions of people to make decisions which do not seem obvious to them .
employment would be greatly helped by an extension of energy efficiency .
this has been proved in study after study .
i am therefore deeply disappointed at the negative attitude of the council of ministers which cannot even be bothered to get a proper legal base for the save ii programme .
that is indeed reprehensible , given the urgency .
i think we will see this week a very clear expression of the will of the european parliament representing people in every member state .
that will is to say : ' let us have much stronger measures for energy efficiency ' .
save ii is nowhere near ambitious enough .
it has not learned all the lessons from save i. it is a very limited , minimal approach but it is absolutely essential that the council of ministers knows that the european parliament is backing it very strongly indeed .
mr president , on behalf of the european people 's party i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , both on the content of her report and on the consensus that she fostered in the committee .
that consensus has led to a number of common conclusions which i will not spell out in detail now .
however , it is worth pointing out once again that with this programme we are seeking to promote environmental improvement and to increase the competitiveness of europe 's undertakings .
the commission 's proposal to treble the resources for the save ii programme , as compared with the save i programme , is certainly encouraging .
save ii seems to be pointed towards the second of those two paths . however , it would perhaps be better if the funding could be allocated as evenly as possible over the whole duration of the programme .
save ii endeavours to strengthening pilot actions that were undertaken in the first programme and also makes provision for new actions .
as has already been said , the programme ignores the positive results that have stemmed from legislative measures and the possibility of achieving a further increase in energy efficiency via the same route .
although i do not believe that legislation would help us down that route , i feel that we should not disregard the experience that we have gained from the past at a very heavy price .
i would therefore advise the commission to look for a middle way , so as to provide an impetus to small and medium-sized enterprises in particular , as i said before .
however , it would also be useful if the commission were to take account of the need to achieve convergence between the member states in the area of energy efficiency .
mr president , i support mrs bloch von blottnitz 's report .
she introduced it with her usual efficiency .
it is important that we support the continuation of the save energy efficiency programme with a budget of ecu 120m for the period from 1996 to 2000 .
the save initiative , which dates back to 1991 , is one of the cornerstones for the european union policies to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 .
the renewal of the save programme may be timely as the european commission reports that the carbon dioxide target is being exceeded by 5 % .
indeed , according to estimates , carbon dioxide accounts for 50 % of the greenhouse gases now present in the atmosphere .
between 1991 and 1994 the save programme funded a total of 203 pilot projects in the energy efficiency field .
in ireland alone we undertook 12 pilot projects with the assistance of save funds .
so i fully agree with the objective to improve energy efficiency by a further 1.5 % per annum within the european union .
it is important in this context that the save initiatives should be coordinated with other european union energy initiatives such as thermie and synergy .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am pleased first of all to compliment the rapporteur on the excellent report on save ii .
this report makes a contribution to the difficult but important battle for a sustainable environment and a sustainable development of our economy .
for the group of the european liberal , democratic and reformist party sustainable development means a situation in which the natural raw materials are so used that future generations can also make use of them in the same way .
liberals start with their own responsibility and do not shuffle it off on to succeeding generations .
that of course means that there must be sustainable management of natural resources . there is a price-tag on pollution .
so the environmental costs of consumption and production must be made visible in the economy .
the committee on energy has approved 35 amendments , four of them from the group of the european liberal , democratic and reformist party .
i should like to explain two of them .
a shift , ladies and gentlemen , in the use of energy sources , in particular in the direction of renewable energy sources , could make these figures considerably more attractive .
that should be encouraged in the framework of save ii .
it is essential to apply modern energy technologies and to switch to cleaner industries in eastern europe .
that is good for the environment and good for the economy and benefits both the union and third countries .
that is what makes this collaboration so significant .
mr president , it is certainly appropriate that at least one representative of a nordic state should take part in this debate on the programme for the promotion of energy efficiency .
there is quite a lot of snow too .
in the north , particularly in a country dominated by the paper industry , industrial users of course consume an enormous amount of energy , but we also use a lot of energy in heating .
this winter has been particularly cold , and this has meant that considerably more energy has been used than normal .
of course , we cannot do anything about the forces of nature .
we can , however , do a lot to improve energy efficiency . in finland , for example , there are currently enormous quantities of wood , of waste wood , which nobody uses .
and in order to make use of these forms of energy , we need money for research ; there is also plenty of room for improvement as regards all the existing forms of energy .
the directive on refrigerators , which the next speaker mr macartney has reported on , may even now be being debated in the council .
indeed , parliament has only just debated this directive , and it must be said that in many developed countries the objectives set out there do not represent anything new .
we need to set more ambitious objectives and ensure that the old , wasteful sources of energy are modernized .
the save programme is of great importance in all this improvement of energy efficiency , but in itself it does not help as much as it could .
i hope that this save ii programme will be adopted but there is much that could be done to improve it .
i have to say that it is a bit like motherhood .
everyone supports energy savings , everyone is in favour of motherhood .
but where are the real supports .
the commission has failed with these proposals to give us real support , key legislative proposals .
parliament has stepped in and , correctly , pointed this out .
we do not have very much time left before the year 2000 to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves .
let us have some real legislative proposals this time around .
the most important thing we have done recently is to evaluate the save programme .
we have done an excellent evaluation and have come up with the real result that you need legislative proposals .
we need teeth to make the save proposals sink in .
unless we get teeth the member states will not do the work . we will not get the results we need .
we have to harmonize with other programmes .
we have to harmonize with thermie and synergy and we have to export these ideas to third countries , particularly the east .
but let us show an example ourselves .
where are the save programmes for the european parliament ?
where are the energy saving programmes for the commission ?
let us do some real work ourselves on our own buildings .
buildings are shooting up here and in brussels .
where are the real energy saving proposals there ?
we pontificate about what third countries and peripheral states should do all the time .
let us do something real here in the heart of europe where we have money .
let us do it legislatively and with fiscal instruments .
i do not accept that we cannot use fiscal instruments .
it is about time we got back to using them .
mr president , i wish to respond to the point made by mrs stenius-kaukonen that those of us who live in the more northerly parts of europe suffer from colder winters !
it is something which is fairly obvious when you state it but clearly it has profound implications for the people who live in those climates .
a lot of lessons could be learned by our people and these could be applied right across europe to everybody 's benefit .
later on in this parliament we shall be returning again to the subject of domestic freezers and fridges , which is a subject that often causes eyes to glaze over , i have to admit .
but when people realize how much energy the fridge or the freezer in their house consumes all the year round , i think they will realize this is important .
mr president , almost three years ago today i stood in this spot and delivered the opinion of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection on the save i programme .
save i , which parliament criticized for having insufficient finance and ambition , detailed 13 legal actions and standards that would be undertaken .
in practice , only four directives emerged and it is unacceptable that the present proposal makes no reference to the failure of save i as a legislative programme .
for instance , we still have no directive on energy efficiency of buildings .
at the time of rio there was great excitement .
we believed in those targets . this programme does not go far enough to meet those targets .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur , mrs bloch von blottnitz , for her very important report , and also the draftsmen of the opinions of the parliamentary committees .
the save i programme which ended in 1995 was initially devised as an energy efficiency programme . however , as it progressed it became the cornerstone of the european union 's strategy for reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
however , we have also been guided by another factor , namely the lack of progress on the question of an energy tax .
and it is precisely that which has led us into developing save ii as a wider and fuller initiative .
mr president , commissioner , i would like you to tell me when you will be presenting the legislative proposals . you said it would be very soon .
we are calling for legislative proposals and you say they have already been implemented . surely that is not the case .
the directive merely refers to the measures , while it is left open to the member states whether they implement them or not . but they have not done so .
that is precisely what we need in save ii . after all , it is useless simply to leave the implementation of such measures to the member states .
it is true that the forecasts and estimates for the next 200 years provide grounds for claiming that energy reserves are plentiful , but they are for the most part located outside the european union .
and the energy dependency of the european union , already of the order of 48 % , could reach 70 % by the year 2020 .
maintaining the security of eu countries , and world stability and peace , require clear-headedness , a vigorous approach and a search for worldwide energy cooperation .
mr soulier has provided some figures which indicate how the general energy picture is likely to evolve in the immediate future .
i will not repeat them , but i do agree .
in the light of those figures the synergy programme assumes particularly great importance because in focusing on third countries and providing them with assistance it will help those countries formulate and implement energy policies of their own .
mr president , let me by way of introduction remind you again of the position of the committee on budgets , namely that no important measures should be financed from the general budget without an appropriate legal base .
this differentiated breakdown shows that the synergy programme gives a greater financial contribution to the administrative costs than to the operational projects .
the companies certainly benefit from the energy charter and certainly have the financial resources to finance the secretariat .
for that reason , the citizens of the eu cannot be asked to continue paying for this .
the committee on budgets already pointed out when the treaty was signed that it must not imply any significant budgetary burden on the eu , and that , we believe , is how it should remain .
we need a change of energy policy .
let me briefly raise three aspects . firstly , the 25 billion tonnes of co2 emissions we puff into the air every year damage our climate and destroy our natural environment .
secondly , the potential of nuclear energy is limited .
we already have some 120 000 tonnes of radioactive waste and nobody knows what is to be done with it .
thirdly , of course there is a growing energy demand because everyone on this earth has a right to quality of life .
that is why the commission 's proposal to develop a strategy of cross-frontier cooperation is most welcome .
however , a programme of this kind , which after all accounts for ecu 50 million , must also satisfy certain requirements .
co2 emissions are a cross-border problem and require a european approach .
the eco-tax is an excellent means for that .
the netherlands are at present the only member state to have energy taxation , but co2 emissions are not only a european but a world-wide problem .
i should also like to say , along with another colleague , that nuclear safety does not belong in such a programme . we have other programmes devoted to nuclear safety .
there are great problems in trying to export nuclear technology to developing countries . for example , we have not solved the problems of waste .
finally , concerning the rational use of energy and sustainable development , we need to be developing them through fiscal instruments in particular .
i agree with a global approach on this level . we should follow the rio agenda .
the co-ordination of energy policies in relation with third countries is a priority and should not just be seen as an appendix but as part and parcel of any future european energy policy .
i hope that the recent proposal by the portuguese foreign minister to hold regular euro-african summits can open up opportunities in this area .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i should like to thank mr soulier for his marvellous report .
mr president , if i have understood correctly , the ministers for transport have recently been doing some soulsearching about the future of goods transport by rail . it is about time too .
the directive on the interoperability of the trans-european high- speed rail system and its history and content still do not bring that dawn .
seven years have gone by between the initiative and this second reading .
what is the result of all that ? movement backwards , which the often strained relations between the national authorities and the rail companies seem to confirm .
' with the amendments made by the council to the proposal for a directive the aims sought by the commission in its original proposals have been drastically altered .
that is the end of the quotation , with my apologies for the involved wording .
that quotation is the commission 's conclusion which above all stresses once more the wish to take account of users ' needs and expresses regret at the council 's attitude .
the second reading must make it clear to the council once more by the proposals for amendment the essence of what is involved in the matters we are discussing together today .
europe 's rail systems must be compatible .
they must work together . they must share the same technical standards .
they must do that if europe 's railways are to fulfil their potential to shift passengers and freight from our congested roads and airspace so that we meet our environmental objectives .
secondly , we must realize our potential to become more competitive as europeans and to foster growth and employment .
however , we can only build europe 's railways for the 21st century if we standardize our national railway systems that were created in the 19th century . it will cost money .
this evening i wish to focus on the need for passengers to have easy access to the whole of the european high-speed network . that includes passengers with disabilities .
a case in point is the marvellous , high-tech , high-speed eurostar train which now serves my constituency and links london to brussels and paris . marvellous , unless you are a disabled passenger .
it applies too to the high-speed lines . furthermore it is just as important for the systems to be interoperable also in the sense that they become more attractive for the user .
mr president , i am speaking on behalf of mr van der waal , who cannot he here because he is ill .
the commission 's proposal on interoperability of the european network for highspeed trains has been drastically altered by the council .
instead of striving for a european network of high-speed trains the accent is now placed more on preservation of the existing national high-speed networks , which have been made interoperable only where necessary or where desired .
adaptation of existing or planned infrastructure costs a lot of money - money which , incidentally , is not available , amongst other things because of the emu criteria .
with hindsight it is very much to be regretted that european standards were not in force before the construction of the national high-speed networks .
those difficulties are apparent if we bear in mind that certain factors - environment , users and management - vary from one country to another .
that is why the council moved away from the original commission proposal and , in some respects , parliament 's amendments .
it is therefore desirable that interoperability be gradually achieved in relation to transfrontier traffic , the rapid transport of goods and , at a later and none-toodistant stage - the whole of rail transport .
here there is an implied attitude which is debatable from the point of view of a broad vision of the process of developing the networks and providing services .
to be specific , from a reading of the provisions of this proposal for a directive the lack of interoperability emerges as a fundamental problem as it creates internal frontiers which hinder freedom of movement .
the interoperability of the networks is therefore a question to be solved first. previously .
once the problem has been expressed in those terms it must be recognized that as long as there is no interoperability there will be no freedom of movement .
but a statement like that is in itself little more than tautology .
the cumulative deficit of the sncf , which is supported by the state , that is the taxpayer , is ff 175 billion .
the commission cannot , however , support the amendment from mr soulier - amendment no 12 - because it would complicate the interoperability framework which we are establishing , and that contradicts the efforts to achieve simplification .
so we are happy to collaborate in the introduction of a uniform system for transport of dangerous materials for the whole territory of the european union .
such a uniform system must guarantee an acceptable level of safety and eliminate existing obstructions to free movement of goods between the member states in the field of means of transport .
the second point concerns informing the competent authorities in advance where transport of extremely dangerous goods is concerned .
the railway accident in flanders on thursday last week made it clear once again that in spite of good safety standards accidents can never be ruled out .
that applies also to transport of extremely dangerous goods .
we think that in the event of an unexpected accident involving particularly dangerous transport operations it is important for the competent authorities to be informed about the operations .
i appreciate that it is not easy to lay down practicable criteria for the concept of ' extremely dangerous goods ' . for that i shall rely on the creativity of directorate general vii .
it is also proposed to transpose into community law the rules contained in the rid regulations as they are applied to international rail transport to include operations within member states . these moves are strongly supported by my group .
while we as a group can support the position adopted by the rapporteur and the committee on transport and tourism , we have some reservations about the number of derogations introduced by the council , particularly in article 5 .
we believe this could have the effect of putting rail at a disadvantage compared to other modes of transportation .
the aims are clearly to achieve the highest level of safety and to establish a single market for these transport services within europe .
for instance , it has been made compulsory for the member states to notify the competent authorities so that they can alert the emergency services throughout the territory to be crossed .
the proposal is intended to remove existing obstacles to free movement of goods between member states . having the same regime for all transport of dangerous goods obviously adds transparency and clarity for the user and ensures greater safety .
clearly , the commission recognises that existing national regimes for the transport of dangerous goods have developed separately and diversely . we naturally appreciate that harmonization cannot be achieved overnight .
the council increased the flexibility provided for in our original proposal .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his answer , although he must understand that i do not agree with him in all respects .
but i would ask him to be rather more specific in answering my question about how the commission will manage with the concept of ' tunnels with characteristics similar to the channel tunnel ' .
by their very nature these tunnels are huge pieces of infrastructural development . by their very nature they must be secure for the purpose of the transport of dangerous goods .
decision on urgency
madam president , the committee on fisheries has agreed to accept urgent procedure and to ask for this to be placed on the agenda for the procedure without debate .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
the report will therefore be put to the vote on friday morning .
the deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on wednesday .
madam president , the committee on external economic relations yesterday unanimously adopted the request for urgency on the report by mr pex , as you rightly said .
we hope that the house will do the same .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
this item is also placed on the agenda for friday .
the deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on wednesday .
the aim of the programme is to assimilate and increase the efficiency of customs procedures and customs administration .
many of the working methods and organizational structures used by the national customs services vary widely and urgently need to be brought more closely into line with each other .
at first reading we adopted a number of amendments to the programme , many of which the commission has incorporated in its amended proposal .
the council , however , has made it clear in its unanimously adopted common position that it has different priorities from those of parliament .
we had a detailed discussion with the commission and the council in the committee on whether or not we have community customs .
the recommendation before you at second reading lays emphasis on the further development of the european internal market into a proper european home market with open internal borders and a common external border .
particular attention is to be paid to the associated countries of central and eastern europe .
as a first step towards an eventual common customs administration , customs officials are to wear the twelve-star symbol of the community to make it clear that they belong to a common service .
in my opinion , this last point is particularly important and could be especially useful in protecting the community 's financial interests .
the people who will be most affected by this development are freight carriers , who are liable to the customs administration for the proper execution of the transport procedures .
there are huge sums of money involved here , and the carriers are required to provide the customs office with security for their liability .
cases of fraudulent evasion of customs duties which are discovered by the customs authorities result in enormous penalties for the carriers .
in the netherlands alone , carriers have had to pay almost ecu 900 million , the situation in germany being almost as bad .
for europe as a whole , the figure is estimated at around ecu 3 billion , and it is often only fairly small-scale firms which are involved .
individual firms have faced demands for more than dm 50 million , for example , and for many this can spell financial ruin .
in calling for the customs services to be fully computerized as quickly as possible , parliament therefore hopes to help prevent fraud and protect jobs .
in the field of legislation too , efforts are being made to achieve harmonization between member states , and there must also be a certain homogeneity between them in the way they interpret this legislation .
but i should like to place particular emphasis , as most members of the committee sought to do , on the fight against all forms of fraud , and fraud arising out of transit operations in particular .
we stress that sufficient funds should be made available under this programme to enable the declarations of intent to be expressed in action in the field .
such are the conclusions of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy and at this point i should like to thank our rapporteur and chairman mr von wogau .
i repeat , if we want to be credible we must combat all the many forms of fraud which abound within the union and which prompt nationalist reactions .
madam president , a single market needs common protection .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should first of all like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of my group for the great commitment he has shown over a number of weeks while working on this recommendation .
the community has uniform customs legislation and should therefore ensure that customs controls are applied equally strictly everywhere .
i think the programme you have proposed will be helpful here , but you will also have to monitor it in practice .
i therefore welcome the fact that the commission has said it is prepared to try to help importers and exporters by considering ways to simplify procedures .
i think that this form of partnership between economic operators and customs authorities is a very good idea and should definitely be followed up .
madam president , the issue we are again discussing today - in the hope of being able to arrive at a definition of it - is of the greatest importance for the european internal market .
it is very important to define the powers of customs officers , and these have , of necessity to be uniform throughout the union .
we firmly believe that this proposal may represent a vital step towards the completion of the internal market .
madam president , the customs 2000 programme is very important and it is still more important to launch it with realistic objectives .
in this respect parliament is perhaps attempting to achieve rather overambitious objectives too quickly .
for a long time to come we will be aiming rather at speedier cooperation between customs systems than at a separate common customs system - not least because there are still very sensitive issues associated with the external borders .
the greens wish to stress the importance of customs cooperation with third countries and the european union 's immediate neighbours .
in our opinion at least one-fifth of the customs 2000 funds should be used to develop those countries ' customs institutions and cooperation with them .
madam president , both the proposed programme and mr von wogau 's report are something of a curate 's egg .
one last point .
the planned accession of the countries of central and eastern europe will mean extra work for the european union , and we should start now to prepare the ground for future cooperation with the customs services of these countries .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , mr jarzembowski welcomed the fact that the programme specifically includes economic operators .
but if only we had included them in the past and heeded their warnings , we would not now be planning to extend the t1 system to cover the visegrad states .
to put it bluntly , there is no point in having talks with economic operators or with the customs authorities if we do not draw the appropriate conclusions .
if all that happens at the end of the day is that a political decision is taken which cannot be justified in practical terms , then even the most constructive talks are useless .
nevertheless , we would of course welcome the continuation of talks as part of this programme .
i have a comment to make about amendment no 16 , which has caused some misunderstanding because it calls for direct customs control to have priority over every other method .
this does not mean , of course , that every lorry has to be unloaded at the border or its destination , which would , as we all know , be quite stupid .
the aim is not to find a scapegoat and hold them responsible for as long as possible .
the aim must be to take deterrent and preventive action , and this is only possible with controls .
noone was in any doubt about that .
and there is no doubt that the romantic symbol of gold stars on the customs officers ' new uniform is going to do anything to solve this problem ...
the measures which must be taken are well and truly enshrined in articles 7 and 8 .
will those measures be taken ?
will there be really any interest among the member states to take these measures ?
will not many top officials in various member states be interested in making sure that there is a certain freedom in terms of fraud so that competition takes place and their products can be sold ?
to what extent can member states be made responsible for ensuring that provision already taken should actually be executed ?
otherwise the whole of this can have no effect and the customs 2000 programme will just be another document worked out by the commission and the council of ministers .
madam president , i have only a few brief comments to make on a report whose conclusions i largely support .
this means that the individual member states should undertake to achieve at least a certain standard of control but that they will be at complete liberty to introduce a stricter system of checks if they so wish .
in the debate in the committee on economic affairs mr von wogau also confirmed that the criteria would be of this minimum nature .
i should like to point out that there is considerable concern in my country that the single market may make it more difficult for us to carry out effective customs to prevent the importation of drugs .
an overwhelming majority of the population want us to be able to step up inspections if we so wish .
for this reason i am also critical of the formulations in amendment no 3 .
finally , madam president , i have my doubts about the value of customs officials ' uniforms bearing the eu logo with the twelve stars .
i therefore regard the twelve stars as a worthless symbol .
i admit , however , that this issue is completely insignificant and it does not affect my positive attitude to mr von wogau 's report .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur , mr von wogau , for the important work he has done .
as stated in the report , the vital precondition for creating a genuine internal market is that there has to be joint protection of external frontiers .
bearing in mind those fundamental objectives , the commission put forward this text on 6 april 1995 , and it was first considered by the house on 25 october last .
of the 34 amendments you then tabled , 23 were taken up by the commission in its amended proposal of 21 november , and 14 adopted by the council in the common position of 22 december 1995 .
similarly , this decision does not of itself represent the main instrument devised by the commission to tackle serious but specific problems it has identified in relation to fraud , particularly as regards transit .
those issues will be specifically dealt with , in separate proposals , in a different context .
nonetheless , the ' customs 2000 ' programme will provide a framework particularly suited to developing a genuine policy of prevention to combat customs fraud .
and it is in the light of those objectives that the commission has weighed up the amendments tabled in your draft decision on second reading .
the house proposes incorporating 23 amendments into the common position of the council - on which the commission gave its view on 11 january .
that being so , the commission undertakes to include those issues in the work that will be done in implementing this programme .
to conclude , the commission welcomes the great interest that the ' customs 2000 ' programme has generated in the house and the active support our proposal has been given .
thank you , mr monti .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
industrial policy for the pharmaceutical sector
ladies and gentlemen , this report is sure to provoke very widely differing views on the industrial policy we should pursue in the pharmaceutical sector .
i should like to pick up on this point .
mr bangemann , we were at the emea conference in london together , and i assume that you , as a forward-thinking consumer protector , will also support these demands .
i would like to stress that certain passages in this report have been watered down as a compromise , to ensure that it would receive a majority .
this is , of course , not the ideal way to produce a report , but in the end the wording is always some sort of compromise .
we are also calling for a responsible export policy in the pharmaceutical sector , with the introduction of a code of conduct .
let me be quite clear about this . a modern industrial policy must not be geared towards either producers or customers .
it must be geared towards society and its legitimate needs , and above all , mr bangemann , it must have the courage to innovate .
in my view , the report should be adopted as it stands .
i hope that it will be widely supported , and i would be delighted if it helped to give the people of europe confidence in our ability to protect those who are ill .
madam president , i should like to start where the rapporteur has left off .
we have to recognize , however , that the idea of having an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry is rather different from the other industries we have dealt with in the past .
we have to acknowledge that the pharmaceutical industry is intimately linked to health issues and to the national social security systems of our member states .
when we determine an industrial policy - which we should do for the pharmaceutical sector - we have to recognize that it is a much broader sector than the other industries we have looked at in the past .
at a time when governments are trying to cut their budget deficits , we have to look at the costs involved in buying the pharmaceuticals for the health of our nations .
to ensure that we have healthy citizens we have to ensure that drugs are as inexpensive as possible .
the socialist group supports an industrial policy .
we do not believe that we should cherry-pick .
we want to see a comprehensive industrial strategy for the european union and we do not believe we should only look at industries which are in decline .
therefore , we welcome the commission 's proposal to look at the pharmaceutical industry .
there is global competition in this sector .
we recognize that with global markets we have to look at this key industry and ensure that it is competitive within the european union .
that is why the report we have produced looks at a number of key issues .
we want to encourage innovation .
we want adequate protection of new medicinal products .
we want the availability of medicinal products for citizens throughout the european union .
but in addition - and we see no contradiction in this - we want the development of an eu-based generic pharmaceutical industry as a positive contribution to competition .
there is no contradiction if we recognize the importance of the pharmaceutical industry for the health of our citizens and for our national social security systems .
so , we want a well-balanced industrial policy but we want to make sure that this balance recognizes the responsibility that the pharmaceutical industry has in europe .
it has its industrial responsibilities but also a responsibility towards every single citizen that may need to use these products in the future .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission report has been out for two years now , and the house has discussed it in great detail over that period .
it is a good thing that mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer can now tell us that the wording of various passages has been watered down , because the proposals she originally put forward were completely unworkable .
this is not the right way to go about things .
we feel that the commission report paints a relatively accurate picture , but the proposals which it puts forward still need some improvement .
we agree with the socialist group 's analysis here .
the most controversial subject in the committee was the issue of generic medicines , on which there was fierce lobbying from the industry .
this is one area where we can actually achieve something , and i think it would be a good way to promote greater transparency and more competition on the market .
there are a number of factors which they have completely overlooked , however .
first and foremost , there is the importance of medical progress .
research and progress in the pharmaceutical industry depend entirely on having a watertight patent protection period .
secondly , we must not forget that the market for generics is a purely commercial one and involves only products which are commercially successful .
thirdly , the comparison with the situation in the united states does not hold water .
the united states does not have price regulation , so the pharmaceutical industry can recover its research costs more quickly .
the solution lies in free pricing , not in cutting down on the patent protection periods .
the american market is also not fragmented as it is in the union , where the protection period is calculated from the first time a licence is granted in any of the member states .
finally , the innovative pharmaceutical sector is one of the leading generators of employment .
it has a much greater multiplier effect on other sectors and itself employs 530 000 people in europe , 80 000 of them highly skilled .
apart from her desire to reduce the patent protection periods , it is the rapporteur 's views on genetic technology and biotechnology which cause me the greatest anxiety .
i hope that when you vote , ladies and gentlemen , you will put the interests of medical progress and a competitive pharmaceutical industry in europe first .
madam president , in relation to this report it is important to emphasise the special nature of the pharmaceutical industrial sector .
it is umbilically linked to public health and , as point e demonstrates , we should first of all aim at the objective of providing the whole population with safe and efficient medicines .
this undeniable priority comes up at community level against the differences between the health systems and social security regimes in the different member states and various national peculiarities .
on one hand it is a sector which illustrates in the extreme and with many contradictions the process of private transnationalisation leading to the destruction of national industrial sectors .
the case of portugal would be a perfect example of this accelerated and perverse evolution which has made the production and trade in medicines completely dependent on the outside .
it is obvious that the pharmaceuticals industry demands huge resources and calls for extremely burdensome research spending .
however it is very important to prevent that research and development from being exclusively at the service of private interests rather than mankind as a whole or public health .
the delicate nature of these questions and the dimension of the interests at stake are both reflected in the report which should deal less with the market and prices .
but that is how things are .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , what we are doing here is developing a european industrial policy for a particular sector .
in the pharmaceutical sector , we need to reconcile a number of different interests .
first of all , there is our common heritage of biodiversity and acquired scientific knowledge , the latter being a basic prerequisite for the development of pharmaceutical products .
secondly , there are the interests of society , since our social security and healthcare systems are greatly affected by price levels in this sector .
thirdly , there is our common interest in lasting innovation for the future , which means that we will always need industrialists , and they in turn will always need a challenge .
big profits are not enough , otherwise we would have seen a flood of industrial innovation in europe in recent years , which has clearly not been the case .
those who have invested in the sector , however , quite legitimately wish to see a return on their capital .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a commendable report , despite a rather unfortunate title .
is not an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical sector reminiscent of the planning we used to see in the iron curtain countries ?
the argumentation without discussion is cast in the same mould .
while it is admittedly impossible to harmonize the management policies in the pharmaceutical sector , there are certain major subjects of concern which this report fails to address .
a specific approach to this problem is essential due to the appearance of new forms of nonepidemiological illnesses .
a medicine exists because it provides treatment , irrespective of whether it is profitable or not .
japan and the united states have awarded orphan drugs special status .
in europe there is a legal vacuum in this area .
this question of orphan drugs leads us to the whole matter of public health .
europe should endeavour to promote this protection of life at all levels , without excluding the so-called risk groups or the victims of rare diseases .
a healthy notion of public health must allow every individual to obtain treatment according to his real needs .
this communication from the commission seems to be seeking to ascertain how best to restrict the supply of health care .
this is unacceptable .
when you then add to this a failure to understand the market economy , the potion becomes all the more poisonous .
just one additional question : how do people view the merger of ciba-geigy and hoffmann-laroche , which is a result of this report ?
madam president , i wish to record my thanks to the rapporteur for her important work on this key industrial sector in the european union .
we have no real public health strategy for the european union , and this is an important omission , which perhaps we can rectify in other pieces of work .
the rapporteur has rightly drawn attention to some of the problems of the sector and particularly to the way in which companies in the united states of america are in many ways making gains .
the area i wish to concentrate on particularly is responsible self-medication .
there is also an important cost element here and sometimes these two objectives can be in contradiction .
this leads me on to the important role of the pharmacist in the sale and prescription of over-the-counter medicines .
we need effective labelling , effective and comprehensive testing and pharmaceutical advice if patients are to make a genuine , informed choice about over-the-counter prescriptions .
it is difficult to balance the need for adequate regulation and the safeguarding of patients ' rights .
now , perhaps that might be more tenuous were we to look at it in a worldwide context .
i welcome the report .
i welcome the innovation .
i do not agree that we need a pharmaceutical industry with price controls as they are at the moment , but this is an important contribution to a key-sector policy development .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as a practising pharmacist and someone with research experience in the pharmaceutical industry , there are two points that i should like to make .
the most obvious thing that the medical profession does is to advise patients and help them with self-medication .
the transition of medicines from being prescription-only to being available over the counter must be carefully monitored .
only those who have no idea of the huge costs involved in researching new drugs could be in favour of granting earlier licences for generics .
the comparison with the united states , it must be said , simply does not hold water .
as has already been pointed out , patents are protected for 16 years nationwide in the us , whereas in europe , protection only takes effect once the product has been licensed in the various individual countries .
i am not in favour of making generics prescription-only , since i think it is better to leave them to market forces .
madam president , few reports have been the subject of such intensive lobbying by the industry concerned and i think this is always instructive .
the absence of a free market in pharmaceutical products is regrettable .
i suspect that the cost of moving to a free market would be much lower than we imagine but , of course , once the psychology of restricted markets has taken hold it is hard to get over that .
but if we need a free market we also need normal patent procedures .
why cannot we allow , as they do in the united states , companies producing generic medicines to begin their development work in advance of the expiry of patents ?
we know that this work is done for european companies in turkey and in iceland , for example .
it is costing us jobs here in the european union .
there is more than a little hypocrisy among the large pharmaceutical companies , most of which have generic subsidiaries .
they want to hunt with the hounds and to run with the hare .
in the united states they see the generic medicine sector as an important job creator .
this report calls for the opening of that sector .
all of these would lead to a safer , healthier society with more sustainable medicinal practices and a pharmaceutical industry better geared to meet the challenges of the future .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , a large part of our european identity is based on our system of social protection and , in particular , our system of health insurance .
in this respect , mrs soltwedel has drawn up a very clear and detailed report which deserves our praise .
at the international level , the pharmaceutical sector is going through a period of upheaval , caught between the globalization of competition and cost-cutting measures applied to public health systems .
although europe has a large medicines market , it also fortunately has a great scientific and industrial tradition : something known as good manufacturing practice , a notion which must be preserved .
medicines are an essential factor in protecting health .
the availability , quality , effectiveness and safety of medicines must all be improved - on this point the report is categoric - in order to guarantee treatment or cure for everybody , and also prevention .
in this respect we must always remember the importance of information and the essential health safety on which insufficient stress is laid .
any fudging in this area is to be rejected .
we must impose strict regulations and not leave the market to impose its own rules .
in regard to reagents , which were recently the subject of a debate in this house , we must of course refer to the sad case of the ' abbot ' aids screening tests .
i repeat , it is essential to prevent any backsliding and to establish sufficient health safety not only between the member states but everywhere .
let us learn the necessary lessons from the situation caused by the bovine spongiform encephalopathy prion .
we must not limit the action of the public authorities in this field and confine the pharmaceutical sector to the area of industrial policy alone .
there is also the matter of health and people 's lives to be considered .
i repeat , that is what health safety is all about .
we must also endeavour to increase price transparency , although i know that the treaties do not , unfortunately , yet allow us to cause governments and laboratories to make an effort on this subject .
i am in favour of the use of generic medicines , but we must not dismantle the system of patents , without which there would be no research or investment , the costs of which are a growing burden .
as to gentle and homeopathic medicines , these attract me but also leave me sceptical .
finally , i welcome the creation of the european medicine evaluation agency .
i see this is an excellent first step towards community regulation .
i should like to end by looking at the need for bioethics and also add that i see europe 's increasing drug consumption as harmful .
there are countries which stuff themselves with tranquilizers , but i do not know of any pill against misfortune or unemployment .
it calls the attention of governments and of public opinion to the need to create a social climate conducive to therapeutic research .
we cannot support the report presented by the rapporteur .
the group of the european people 's party has therefore tabled a block of amendments which we think it is essential to approve .
it must not be forgotten that therapeutic progress would be best served by the promotion of innovation as would lightening the future burdens on social security systems .
the best protection of the interests of patients as consumers is the availability of high quality , safe and effective medicines .
we forget that a medicine is an active substance coupled with a process of pharmacological and clinical research , plus information and civil and criminal liability .
medicines known as ' generic ' , which make no contribution to therapeutic or social progress , contribute nothing to that .
it is only a factor of selfregulation and must be taken as such .
many of the speeches made by distinguished fellow-members on this report forget that there is very full legislation in the european union and that this communication deals only with the perspectives of an industrial pharmaceutical policy .
if we had concentrated on that , perhaps we should have achieved a better result and practically full support for the commission 's proposals .
madam president , i too am a small but active minority within the group of the european people 's party .
pharmaceutical research is both costly and time-consuming , and it can take up to ten or twelve years before a new medicine is ready to be put on the market .
in 1993 the average cost of research and development was estimated at ecu 275 million .
you can well imagine that sums like this can only be generated by companies with sufficient cashflow throughout the ten years which it takes to develop a new product .
and not only are the costs high , there is also a considerable element of risk involved .
all of this means that it is only the really big companies that can spare the money for research and development .
i obviously do not want american patent-holders to carry on benefiting once the patent has expired .
the patent period was the reward we offered the industry under the previous gatt system , in return for its investment in developing new products .
so we need to introduce an exemption in europe to allow research into generic medicines to start before the patents on them expire .
we need to allow products to be developed and marketed as soon as possible , so that production costs can be recouped as quickly as possible .
if the house does not support paragraph 17 , we shall simply be relegating our industry still further down the table .
madam president , this debate has shown that our communication was very necessary and , in my view , that we still need to discuss this issue further .
a number of questions have been raised here today which need to be examined in detail .
our communication clearly shows that this is not the case .
the community 's industrial policy in the pharmaceutical sector needs to take account of both the public health and social security aspects , without undermining the member states ' powers in this field .
maybe attacking the commission is just a good way of enlivening the debate , and it is something we are quite accustomed to .
what are the problems here ?
in the 1980s , employment in the sector could be expected to grow by more than 2 % a year on average .
as mrs peijs said , the situation with patents is also looking rather bleak , and this may also explain why employment has fallen .
between 1975 and 1979 , 61 % of all new pharmaceuticals were developed in europe , but the figure dropped to 48 % , in other words to less than half the total , between 1990 and 1994 .
over the same period , the united states ' share grew from 26 % to 31 % and japan 's from 11 % to 31 % .
if we include biotechnology , which is of course one of the major fields of innovation and will become particularly important over the next few years , the situation looks even grimmer .
patents at the clinical and pre-clinical development stage account for 58 % and 48 % of all patents held by american firms , in other words around half .
for european firms , however , the figures are only 26 % and 16 % .
what this means in policy terms is that we are dealing with an industry which is very competitive , even on the international market , but which is also in decline .
this is something the communication naturally also deals with - it is , after all , a communication on industrial policy .
but this is not a health report , and health is not one of my responsibilities .
what is more , the union is not responsible for all health policy matters , and this is a problem i shall come back to later .
the link here is obvious , because the pharmaceutical industry would not exist if it did not work in tandem with the healthcare and in particular the social security systems .
we would seem to be caught in a vicious circle , and it is up to us to find a way out .
the first thing we proposed was to establish a single market in this sector , an idea which has never actually been disputed .
pharmaceutical products should be subject to the rules of the single market , just as other products are .
this does not mean that they should always be treated like other products .
we have introduced a licensing procedure which has , in my opinion , come up to the mark so far , and we shall have to see how it progresses in future .
this was why we visited the agency .
i also have no objection to involving consumers and other organizations in assessing the results of this procedure and in evaluating medicines and the licences granted .
i have no objection to setting up an ethics committee , mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer .
but if you do , you will have to accept its findings , even if you do not agree with them .
this is not the case here , mr langen .
i am a very open person , as you know .
i am even prepared to be friendly , which shows you just how open i am .
what i cannot tolerate , however , is for people to demand an ethics committee and then refuse to accept its findings .
we have an ethics committee on food production and labelling , and i would remind you that it endorsed our views .
we did not ask it to do so , and there was no lobbying .
the members of the committee are completely independent , and they said the commission was right .
we have already dealt with the self-medication issues .
medicines are licensed as prescription drugs , pharmacy drugs or over-the-counter drugs , which means that the system is suitable for use throughout the union .
and - something which is particularly important with new drugs - we have already put in place some of the legal protection called for in this report .
the protection offered by patents can now be extended , in the sense that the unfortunate situation whereby the testing period had to be deducted from the length of the patent no longer exists .
this has already been dealt with , and we do not need to discuss it further .
the usa and japan have even followed our example .
so we are by no means starting from scratch , and what we have to do now is consider what to do next .
we are left with the four problems that mr langen mentioned , which summarize the situation very well .
first of all , which will be more useful : more competition or more regulation ?
i think a combination of the two would work best , both for the industry , for cutting costs , and for consumer supply .
some regulation will of course be required , and we have no desire to limit the powers of the public authorities here .
we need them to exercise their powers , as is entirely right and proper .
but this too is no guarantee .
take bse , for example .
it had nothing to do with competition or the commission , it was the public authorities who allowed it .
experience has shown that making a public authority responsible for something is unfortunately not always the best thing to do .
but this does not , of course , mean that we do not need public involvement in this particular field .
this is why i am convinced that experience is best of all .
you only have to look at the second question mr langen raised , about generic medicines and self-medication , which mrs read also mentioned .
what is the situation here ?
in countries which do not have competitive pricing , such as spain , mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer , where there are fixed minimum prices for medicines , there are practically no generics at all .
90 % of the market for generics is concentrated in four countries : germany , the united kingdom , the netherlands and denmark , because they allow price competition , and this gives generics a chance .
so anyone who wants to bring prices down for the consumer should not run away with the idea that fixed minimum prices are the way to do it .
the opposite is actually the case , since consumption tends to increase with fixed minimum prices .
in other words , mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer , total expenditure is greater with fixed minimum prices than if competition is allowed to set price levels and influence consumer behaviour accordingly .
these are basic market forces , but it is always difficult to have confidence in them , because they seem to be such an artificial mechanism which will inevitably produce bad results .
but this is not what happens .
mrs read is right .
look at how little of the total healthcare budget goes on medicines , for example : 14 % a few years ago , now down to 12 % , and even less in some member states .
hospitals account for the largest proportion , and even there the costs have fallen .
so when we are looking at ways of reducing costs , we should also think about how we can make this work better for us .
this brings me on to the question of how what we do affects the social security systems in the member states .
the council has not said a word on this , nor will it answer any questions about it , for one simple reason .
you are , of course , aware that any interference in these systems has enormous political implications , and we have absolutely no intention of harmonizing the member states ' healthcare systems .
what we actually want to do is to remove the price element from the social security system mechanisms and allow it to be determined by the market .
this will produce two results : low , competitive prices and at the same time proper social protection for patients .
if we succeed in doing this - and we have urged the member states to comply in a special protocol to this communication to the council - we shall already have achieved a great deal .
biotechnology is an extremely important issue here , and will come up again when we look at the patentability of technological discoveries .
i hope that we have now made some progress in this field and that parliament is able to accept the proposal , because there is a very real danger here .
it will not bring us extra jobs either , so what good is such a policy ?
as we can see , biotechnology is really a very important aspect .
finally , there is the question of generic and herbal medicines .
so do not shoot me , i ' m only the piano player , and i shoot back !
on the subject of generics and patent-protected medicines , here too the best idea is to allow both to exist alongside each other .
without innovations there would not be any generics , but at the same time generics play an important role in preventing innovations from becoming so prohibitively expensive that the health sector cannot afford them .
there is a symbiosis between the two : they live off each other .
i find it hard to welcome the idea that laboratory testing is to be allowed before the patent period has expired .
a patent covers only some of the costs that can be incurred in research today , which can run to enormous figures .
someone also pointed out how few medicines have been coming onto the market from research recently .
this is why we need innovations and why they need to be protected .
they can start to compete on price with generics later .
one final comment about mergers , which we also mention in the communication .
of course the competition rules must apply here .
the biggest pharmaceutical company 's share of the market is just under 10 % .
so even among the largest firms , the spread is so great that there will always be competition .
i hope that i have now answered all the points that were raised in the debate , though i am sure that we shall have a good deal more to say on this subject .
it is certainly a sector that is still worth fighting for , but subsidies are not the answer , nor are they what it wants itself , thank goodness .
but it is an industry that is losing its competitiveness , and this is what we must take action to prevent .
mr president , please let me put a supplementary question to mr bangemann , since he was given five times as much speaking time as i was .
before i come back to the pharmaceuticals report , i should just like to put the record straight about bse .
this does not concern you directly , mr bangemann , since it is not one of your responsibilities .
in october , when i went to see mr marchand at the commission to discuss european measures in connection with bse , much was already known which was not made public until six months later .
i am delighted to hear this , and i think it will help to provide much greater protection for patients and consumers .
i should like a straight yes or no on this .
i think you owe it to us to make a clear statement on this point , instead of just referring to what mr langen said .
my final question will probably also be very important for us .
what follow-up will be given to this communication on the pharmaceutical industry ?
can we expect directives or other more compulsory measures for the industry in the next six or twelve months , or will there only be the communication for the time being ?
there was no more to it than that .
i did not say anything about the bse problem as a whole .
of course we could talk about it for hours , but all i actually said was that the example of bse shows that this is not always the case .
i think we would get a good deal further if you did not always suspect me of saying one thing and meaning another .
i am very rarely devious , and i always warn you in advance , so that you know when it is coming .
i said this quite clearly and categorically the first time , and now i have said it again .
naturally a communication such as this is always the basis for further measures .
this will probably be the next item on our agenda , so we shall really want to clarify a few of the points we have mentioned before we produce any further proposals .
there is also the proposal concerning patentability , which i feel is quite important .
once we have dealt with this , we could discuss what else is necessary .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
prevention of drug dependence
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , for this second reading also we have taken into consideration a number of key factors . the first is that drug dependence is no longer a marginal issue .
drug-addicts are not therefore martians : they are , sadly , our children , those who live alongside us .
and if this is our approach to the problem , our starting point , then our response cannot be simple , simplistic , superficial or oversimplified .
what we actually need is to be tough in tackling the problem but also to be willing to talk .
if we are to respond , then we cannot set ourselves apart with our policy or scientific technique - we have to be able to communicate with those working in the field and seeking genuinely to combat drug dependence .
the work with which we , as a committee , tried humbly to make progress is at risk of being undermined .
i want to make that very clear - including to some members of my own group ; i am very much opposed to some of the amendments tabled by the european people 's party also .
but i most particularly disagree with those in the house who are deliberately trying to undermine a vital piece of work , obeying the diktat of certain governments .
i particularly condemn the superficial approach of those who operate on the basis of hearsay ; those who jump from one report to the next without considering the issues in depth .
we cannot tolerate that kind of destructive and superficial attitude to the tragedy of drug-addicts and their families , this social tragedy .
we need - and have proposed this - to make progress on the path to dialogue rejecting all radical approaches .
we have spoken of biological damage but also of the psycho-emotional influence of all drugs , be they soft or hard drugs .
we have described the sociological link between soft and hard drugs , but we also said ' no ' for ethical reasons because we are opposed to drugs sanctioned by the state .
but , just as firmly and energetically as we say ' no ' to liberalization and legalization , we are also opposed to the criminalization of drug addicts because prison neither saves nor rehabilitates them .
prison is a place of damnation : it is in prisons that , very often , drug dependence spreads further .
of course , if a drug addict becomes a pusher , then it is right and necessary that he should pay and answer before the law also .
but the amendment tabled by the committee on the environment , health and consumer protection sought , in cases of that nature too , to place the accent on rehabilitation and not punishment .
a specific commitment to establish certain priorities thus became apparent .
to conclude then , mr president , we say ' no ' to liberalization but , at the same time , no to the criminalization of young drug addicts .
i therefore ask you to reject some of the amendments tabled by the european people 's party , because , as i said at the outset , we cannot take a superficial approach .
we are engaged in a war in which we should all be fighting because we should all consider ourselves very much involved .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would strongly urge the members of this house to approve mr burtone 's report , and the commission and the council to give it their closest consideration .
mr burtone has succeeded in adopting a pragmatic and realistic approach which studiously avoids the usual platitudes .
however , in recent weeks a great deal of nonsense has been talked about the action plan , and in particular about the report itself .
so let us be quite clear about it : this report is not about legalizing or liberalizing any drug whatsoever .
this is a report on a public health issue and certainly does not come under the third pillar .
so let that be an end to all the nonsense .
secondly , at no point does this report approve the taking of drugs .
thirdly , the report stresses the importance of harm-reduction in prevention .
and what is today 's reality ?
what this means is that drugs are not only still available , they are becoming increasingly available .
mr president , i and my entire group are most grateful to mr burtone for his expert guidance in leading us through the first and second readings of this report .
the main focus is on prevention .
how can you stop young people turning to drugs ?
how can you help addicts to give them up ?
how can you limit the health risks ?
the funding available , hfl 12.5 million a year , is merely a drop in the ocean , and is only enough to pay for exchanges of experience , unfortunately .
use european funding for exchanges of experience by all means , but not for specific projects .
we have tabled a number of amendments on this point , and i think it is actually what mr de coene himself would like to see .
the policy of tolerance pursued in the netherlands is not the answer .
it simply makes drugs more easily available and acts as a magnet for addicts from other countries , increasing crime rather than reducing it .
making addiction a crime also does not work .
we wholeheartedly support the harm-reduction policy which the report recommends , and this means that we firmly believe that no distinction should be made between hard and soft drugs .
we have no sympathy , however , with the fatalistic approach adopted by mr de coene , who would have us believe that the fight against those who supply drugs is a lost cause .
tolerance and liberalization are not the answer , since they lead to a vicious circle in which society has to give more and more ground .
on television in the netherlands last sunday a leading socialist , mr tobback , said : ' what has our policy in the netherlands achieved ?
i am the mayor of a city with 35 000 students , and there has not been one single case of a drugs-related death . '
mr president , within every political group in the house there is a majority view and a minority view on the action programme on the prevention of drug dependence .
it is on behalf of the majority of the group of the european liberal , democratic and reformist party that i should like to congratulate mr burtone on his report .
a repressive approach is much more appropriate when applied to large-scale drugs trafficking and organized crime , but it will do nothing to help drug addicts .
it is also right to assume that a completely drugs-free society is nothing more than a pipe-dream , which is being just as realistic as acknowledging that we have a society which uses alcohol and tobacco .
as mr burtone said , we are not talking about life on mars here .
i think it is a pity that the report does not distinguish between hard and soft drugs .
in my country , the netherlands , drugs policy is based on this distinction and has produced very good results in the public health field , compared with other countries in europe .
i am pleased to see that there are a number of amendments which adopt this line in calling for disinfection sets and sterile syringes and needles to be provided in order to combat infectious diseases such as aids .
there are also some very welcome calls , such as in amendment no 23 , for substitute treatments such as methadone to be recognized .
mr president , i think the basic problem is summed up in a report by sir jack stewart-clark for the committee on civil liberties and internal affairs .
in that report it is stated that the g7 financial group considers that in europe and the united states 120 000 million dollars are in circulation bound up with the sale of drugs .
of that amount 85 000 million dollars are laundered in financial institutions .
i think that is the basic problem confronting all the institutions , including the european parliament , which try to deal with such a terrible problem as drug dependence .
we agree with mr burtone 's report and with the inclusion of the amendments at first reading .
those amendments also take into account the social situation of those excluded from society and the social situation of poverty which - not in all cases but in many - leads young people to drug dependence .
in my country 60 % of prisoners are behind bars because of drug dependence , and 40 % of that 60 % have the aids virus .
i know that we do not at present have a majority in parliament who share this view .
the same would apply to alcohol , if only we resolved to get to grips with the problem .
but i do not want to open up the debate on this issue , given the balance of opinion in the house .
one thing worries me : europe has seen a debate of incredible stupidity over recent months .
what are we heading for ?
this really is a bit much to take , ...
this is why our parliament must adopt the burtone report .
i do not agree with everything in it , but it is better than many other things .
mr chirac is a veritable danger to the public when it comes to public health and drugs .
but he will learn as he gets older , he will come to understand , as everybody does .
i therefore approve of the general inspiration behind the report and virtually all the amendments , with the exception of amendment no 8 which refuses to distinguish between hard and soft drugs at the prevention stage .
this is the edifying net result of the policy of repression .
but yet i do not propose to counter the dogma of unprincipled repression with a dogma of liberalization lacking in any public health objectives .
this is a simple , clear and understandable policy .
as long as we fail to courageously advance along this path , crime will continue to prosper from individual tragedies .
mr president , we have now almost finalized the drugs prevention programme .
the common position contains a considerable number of qualitative improvements introduced as a result of amendments proposed by parliament .
it will be easier to allocate funding now that specific projects are planned , which will help both the commission and the member states .
but this is playing into the hands of the drugs dealers , who are indirectly responsible for the destruction of their fellow men .
we reject on principle the acceptance of harm-reduction as a basic approach and addiction as a social phenomenon , since these undermine the very justification for providing assistance .
i therefore also oppose the amendments which aim to have harm-reduction adopted as a strategy .
persuading addicts to kick their drugs habit is a very delicate issue and cannot be governed by any general european strategy .
it is also a curative rather than a preventive measure , and this is not what this action programme is about .
to sum up , i support the common position , but i shall be voting against the burtone recommendation .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should first like to protest against the propaganda on the subject of the burtone report , in the form of the tracts displayed in the corridors of parliament .
i therefore request , as far as possible and in parliament 's interest , the removal of these documents which are posted up all over the place .
now for the real subject of discussion .
repression is clearly in many cases the best form of prevention .
i also observe , as is almost implicit in the report , and extremely explicit in certain amendments - amendments nos 2 and 3 in particular - that a spirit of capitulation lies behind this combat against drugs .
this is totally unacceptable .
i am thinking in particular of amendment no 2 which says that a completely drug-free society is a utopian vision and amendment no 3 which says that the goal should be to limit the adverse effects of drug consumption .
and i did indeed say ' limit ' .
i should like to take an example in the field of economic sciences , namely inflation .
under the pretext that zero inflation is virtually inachievable in a period of economic growth , some economists have always believed that the official policy should be one of low inflation .
in a sense this is exactly what we are trying to do in the field of drugs by saying that , because we cannot totally eradicate them , we should make the official policy that of damage limitation .
as in the case of inflation , and for evident psychological reasons , i believe this to be a mistake .
today it has been made very clear to us that if we want to effectively combat inflation our goal must be zero inflation .
the situation is very similar when we come to drugs .
we must clearly affirm our commitment to combatting them .
another mistake is the way amendment no 4 , for example , suggests that drug addicts are simply people with a health problem .
this is not true : there is indeed a health problem , but also a moral problem and we should not forget this .
sophocles wrote , 2 , 400 years ago in antigone , that the man of knowledge knows how to freely choose between good and evil .
i do not in fact believe we will be helping drug addicts by presenting the whole problem as exclusively a health problem and exempting drug addicts from all responsibility .
on the contrary , i believe this would be presenting them with an additional obstacle when seeking to escape from drugs .
consequently , i believe it is a basic philosophical error to believe that you can dispense with repression in this area .
the human mind is not entirely rational , as we now know thanks to the work of phrenologists such as mac lean , and collective repression is absolutely essential .
it serves no purpose to spend large sums of money if you lack the moral courage .
drugs are spreading because this society is ethically decadent .
we are doomed to failure if we refuse to recognize the moral dimension and only consider the health and sociological aspects .
this is not helping the drug addicts , it is hypocritically allowing the traffickers to go about their business .
what do the traffickers want ?
they want the present situation to continue .
you have been very courageous mr burtone .
you have , through your group , encountered many obstacles .
i have been well aware that you had to steer a course between the two extremes .
it is essential to speak of risk prevention .
but it is not enough .
because here , which is the place to do so and where we can benefit from the experience of others , we must finally acknowledge that we are not making any progress and are in fact regressing .
the lisbon observatory provides us with the tragic figures .
of course there have been arrests and of course drugs have been seized , but drugs are continuing to enter europe in ever larger quantities every year .
the least we can say without making a moral judgment is that the repressive policy is not working .
but that does not mean i favour simply opening up the gates , quite the contrary .
however , i do not believe you are going to get very far by giving equally short shrift to those who want to liberalize and those who simply want to repress .
i greatly admire your courage and this report , but it is not enough .
let us be quite clear : there is racism in drugs .
when i hear of the tragic effects of soft drugs , i think of alcohol and tobacco .
for these are our drugs .
tobacco leads to a dependence estimated at 25 or 35 % .
and what do you do about that ?
but then it 's the state which sells it .
i am speaking from the public health point of view , if you like , but also from a moral and political point of view .
it is tobacco and alcohol which cause most damage in terms of public health .
let us remember this and not demonize other people 's drugs .
we too have our drugs .
what is needed is an economic approach .
we must have the courage to say that we must control , and not simply decriminalize drug use .
just as if you have drunk too much you are not allowed to drive , so if you smoke too much you will not be allowed to drive .
but when you consider that , in my country in particular , there are five million cannabis users , i wonder how we are going to manage to lock them all up .
here in parliament we have the obligation to discuss this matter a great deal more .
we clash with the experience of others rather than listening to it .
we should therefore discuss more among ourselves and benefit from national experiences , both negative and positive .
i believe that this will be progress and that this conference which you mention and which we all want to see , in 1996 , will be a step in the right direction .
finally , we must not demonize any experience or initiative , whether negative or positive .
mr president , drugs are a scourge which destroy our families and kill our young people .
for very many years already the european parliament has concentrated on three courses of action in combatting this tragedy .
firstly , preventing drug addiction , secondly , combatting drug trafficking and the related crime and , thirdly , helping drug addicts to get well again .
today we are interested in the first of these courses of action .
in my eyes this is the most important .
because if drugs lose their attraction for young people , if young people believe that all drugs and stimulants are a threat to the freedom of the individual , the drugs traffic will automatically decline .
finally , let us remember one important principle : programmes undertaken with young people are often far more effective than those undertaken for young people .
i believe that creating a sense of responsibility among those primarily concerned and ensuring their active participation must be a golden rule in preventing drug addiction .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i congratulate mr burtone for the efforts he has made , particularly of late , to tackle the problem with greater clarity but also greater realism .
that then is the reality .
we need then radically to change our approach and we must do this all together , to start with by discussing among ourselves the results so far of prohibition and criminalization .
that is why the most important amendment is amendment no 32 which calls for a conference to be held to discuss scientifically the disastrous results of prohibition and for the international conventions of the united nations to be revised .
mr president , mr burtone has done some wonderful work and he is obviously very concerned about drugs but at the same time i would like to say that i do not share all his views .
like most swedish politicians , my party in sweden , the centre party , can certainly not support the thesis that a drugs-free society is an unattainable utopia .
it is completely mistaken to regard a restrictive policy on all drugs as the antithesis of a policy to reduce suffering and the harmful effects of drug abuse .
however , the european parliament 's proposal will have no effect on swedish laws and regulations , dealing as it does with recommendations for a programme of measures .
unfortunately , however , this type of decision helps to undermine the legitimacy of the european parliament and the confidence of the people of europe in it .
this is an unfortunate consequence of today 's debate .
this debate has also strengthened still further my conviction that the area of criminal law should remain a purely national concern for the member states .
mr president , mr burtone 's report contains a number of different parts .
there are parts that i support , such as the importance that is attached to preventive work and the need for proper care and rehabilitation to help drug addicts give up their abuse .
there are also parts of the report , however , that are not at all acceptable .
it contains a number of more liberal formulations where the policy of what is called ' harm reduction ' is concerned .
this is a philosophy which is aimed at reducing the damage done by abuse , not at combating and putting an end to it .
the report also contains demands for a supranational drugs policy and for a review of existing international conventions .
this is not acceptable .
the un 's drugs conventions should rather be strictly applied by the eu countries as one element in the battle against drugs .
the policy of certain eu countries in the field of drugs today in practice serves to sabotage international cooperation in the fight against drugs .
in the report the issue of drugs is treated as a health issue and dependency as an illness .
drugs are , however , primarily a social and political issue .
the reasons for drug abuse are social conditions , exclusion , unemployment and the lack of future prospects for young people .
the battle against unemployment , social injustice and segregation is thus an important part of the battle against drug abuse - the most important part .
a proper policy for a system of care and rehabilitation which works is also needed .
in this context it is also impossible for society to accept either trafficking in or the possession of drugs - they should be illegal .
there should also be popular opposition to drugs and steadfast and consistent action on the part of the police and customs authorities .
this policy forms a single whole , all parts of which are needed .
mr president , as a socialist i regard the equal worth of all people as a central issue .
i cannot accept that people should be lost to drug abuse .
this is why i would like to see a consistent overall policy with a single goal : a drug-free society .
mr president , it is customary to congratulate a rapporteur .
this report goes against prevailing opinions and the blindness which make a situation which is in itself extremely worrying worse by the day .
so today we are concerned with the question of prevention .
this prevention must clearly be applied to hard drugs in particular , concentrating on intravenous drugs .
it must also be implemented at various levels : the family , schools , universities , associations , municipalities and workshops .
all of these elements must be appraised .
in this respect , holding a conference which would call into question the position of the international community would be very welcome .
mr president , this is one of the absolutely most important issues in europe and the international community as a whole .
it is a matter of how we can best and most effectively tackle the scourge of drugs .
this is a task which places us under an obligation and demands that we , as parliamentarians , accept our responsibilities and do not simply let things rest .
the view expressed by mr burtone 's report is a view which worries me .
it confirms that a re-evaluation is under way of the traditional policy on drugs which used to guide europe and which was the lodestar internationally in work on and the battle against drugs .
it smacks of resignation and lack of enthusiasm .
its message is that the battle against drugs cannot be won - but this is not true .
we know that a restrictive drugs policy combined with a well-developed rehabilitation system produces results .
we know that the fewer the young people who try drugs in the first place , the smaller the number who will become addicted .
this is why preventive work is aimed at young people .
it is by far the most important thing we can do .
it is the most important way of reducing the number of addicts in the future .
a policy which is geared only to reducing the damaging effects of drug abuse which is already taking place sends out completely the wrong signals and devotes resources to a completely wrong objective .
the policy of harm reduction is a policy of negative accommodation .
it is a defeatist policy .
if we are to be successful in combating drug abuse we cannot make distinctions between use and misuse .
nor can we make distinctions between soft and hard drugs .
there is always a risk - irrespective of what we choose to call it - an imminent risk that individuals will become addicted .
i cannot therefore support the burtone report and i hope that this house will be able to produce a more positive and more active policy on drugs .
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin by thanking mr burtone for his report .
it is alarming to see the sharp rise in demand for synthetic drugs , particularly ecstasy , and the careless attitude that people take to these pep-pills , with no thought of the dangers involved .
hopefully , effective addiction prevention measures will succeed in reducing the demand , as they have done in the case of heroin .
i should also like to voice my opposition to any liberalization of drugs , in order to counter the expectation of rising demand .
europe is still seen as a lucrative market where there are profits to be made .
at the same time , any tendency towards liberalization and legalization has the effect of playing down the dangers of illegal drugs and is the greatest obstacle to prevention .
reference is always made in these debates to the consequences of alcohol and nicotine abuse .
not only should these problems be mentioned , but they should be seen as a clear warning , so that we do not end up with the same problems by making soft drugs freely available .
as a practising pharmacist , i oppose any attempt to make hashish or marijuana available from chemists , since that would mean putting drugs on a par with medicines .
instead , i would like to see new models and progress in the area of aid and therapy for drug users , including methadone substitution , though only in the context of therapeutic and psycho-social accompanying measures .
we need to offer improved and more specific counselling and treatment for those who are in danger from , or dependent on , drugs , and their families .
let us support the concept of living without drugs or addictive substances , and let us not trivialize these problems by engaging in a debate that blurs the issues .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am very pleased that the action programme on drug dependence is the subject of discussion in the house today .
90 % of the addicts being treated in my region are under 30 years of age .
we must turn off the tap and stop the continuous supply .
naturally , we must also improve and reinforce treatment programmes .
i welcome the proposals of the common position of the council which include a series of schemes which are clearly more important and more specific than those of the commission 's initial proposal .
efforts must continue in this direction .
in particular , we must increase the resources allocated to treatment cures .
we must also promote improved cooperation between member states and between the competent community bodies in this field .
and would it not also be wise to bring together all the community bodies and agencies active in this area within a single organization ?
it is only by such a pooling of energies that we will be able to effectively combat and eliminate this scourge .
mr president , it is most welcome that we now have our first preventative drugs programme based on health and social considerations .
i hope this is the beginning of better cooperation between the police and home affairs authorities on the one hand and the health and social authorities on the other .
there is a need for cooperation projects between the different authorities .
in finland we have had experience of these problems mainly owing to the import of drugs across our eastern border .
the starting point of drugs policy must be clear : society does not approve of drugs .
the non-medical use of drugs is unacceptable .
when a person learns to regulate his state of mind chemically starting with tobacco and alcohol and ending with drugs , a spiral of exclusion easily starts as a result of over-use .
' legal drugs ' ( tranquillizers ) finding their way on to an illegal market , especially when used in combination with alcohol , are a major and serious problem particularly for young people .
controls must be tightened .
drug education must be carried out skilfully and expertly without shock tactics and together with young people .
further research is also needed .
mr president , i strongly agree with the proposals contained in this report .
for too long in europe we have been concentrating on financial and trade issues at the expense of major social issues such as the drugs problem .
the imbalance has been somewhat redressed by the public health competence given to us by the maastricht treaty .
combined with unemployment and poverty , drugs are laying waste large parts of our cities and destroying the lives of our young people .
in my own city of dublin the number of heroin addicts has been increasing steadily for the last 20 years and is estimated to be about 7 , 000 now .
i would ask commissioner flynn to join with me in urging the irish government to coordinate its efforts with the efforts being made here in europe .
we need , for instance , to increase the size of the drugs squad .
the drugs squad in ireland stands at 1 % of the total force .
that is laughable when 80 % of dublin crime is drug related .
we must also ask for effective coordination between the g&aacute;rdai , the revenue commissioners and the department of social welfare .
it is time that the government came to grips with any remaining industrial relations problems in this area so that the ill-gotten gains of the drug dealers can be targeted .
i visited mountjoy prison recently in dublin .
it is clear to me that a policy of ' containment only ' operates there .
an effective follow-on therapy should be provided for prisoners by the eastern health board .
the ecstasy problem is now escalating out of control and party packs are now widely available in dublin .
we need more education programmes .
i ask the commission to bring forward further programmes along these lines to tackle this life-threatening problem that faces all of europe .
mr president , i have been working on the issue of drugs since the very first committee of inquiry in which i served with sir jack stewartclark .
i found myself pulled in a variety of ways over the years .
very often it is ageing liberals from the ' 60s , like myself , who advocate liberalization , legalization of drugs .
they make a very good case very often .
but generally speaking , the people who take this line are not themselves addicted , are not themselves very often in direct contact with the vast problems related to addiction , and they are complex problems .
of course the element of unemployment and poverty is very significant here .
we need to pay particular attention to our prisons .
contrary to what has been said by the previous speaker , i am happy to tell you that a specialized unit has been opened in the prisons in dublin .
i am sure many colleagues from other countries have experienced the same problem that very often young people in prison , who may not in fact be addicted when they go in , come out addicted .
therefore it is important that one has a unit in prisons where the prisoners themselves can make a choice against drugs .
you will find that a significant number of them will probably make that choice .
while 80 % of the people in our own prisons are there because of drug-connected crime , some of them are not .
this is a contagious disease , as contagious as tuberculosis was in the ' 40s and ' 50s .
we have to treat it like that .
we also have to recognize that our detox and treatment programmes must include not just detox but also an element of teaching life-skills .
you cannot rehabilitate people if many of them have never been habilitated in the first place .
mr president , i know that commissioner flynn shares with us the regret that we do not have total competence in all matters concerned with drugs .
the fact that law and order sits within the third pillar is regrettable .
therefore , this common position is a good first step .
mr burtone has made a sympathetic report and , on the whole , we ought to support this .
my view is that national countries must decide on their own drugs policy .
indeed , if we look at my own country , in scotland and england there are two separate drugs policies .
scotland is more concerned with harm reduction than england .
and here i see an absolutely vital role for the drugs monitoring centre .
that is its value .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the health of the people of the union is something we concern ourselves with as regards foodstuffs and consumer goods .
why should we then not concern ourselves with the health of our fellow citizens where drug abuse and its effects on the brain , lungs and reproductive organs is concerned ?
the policy on drugs must be approached from different angles .
there are no simple solutions .
the goal must be a society free of drugs .
we must find common and national methods which are effective .
the emphasis here must be on prevention and combating drug trafficking , while treatment detection and prosecution are national responsibilities .
if we wish to have the support of the people we cannot use eu resources to finance controversial projects , such as the prescription of heroin .
syringe programmes involving methadon are also controversial , however .
5 % of those who participated in methadon programmes over a period of ten years managed to overcome their addiction - this is not particularly effective .
we should , however , jointly evaluate our special national programmes .
this will also enable us to find a common policy , which will emerge from the results , results which will of course lead to lower demand .
the alternative to this policy is increasing drug abuse and gains for the drug traffickers .
what is important now is to show a willingness to compromise .
this we must do if we are to be able to achieve common measures .
i should also like to thank mr burtone for his commitment to this issue and say that i believe the commission and the council have chosen a realistic , sensible path , which parliament should support .
it is not the drug traffickers but our colleagues in the european institutions that we should support .
every time drugs are discussed in the european union , tempers flare - this time between france and the netherlands .
i am alarmed at how all the protagonists in the debate portray their own opinion as the only legitimate one .
this is an accusation often levelled at mr chirac , but in my experience it is at least as true of those , within and outside this house , who make a fetish of liberalization .
as far as the ppe group is concerned , the contradiction that is often drawn between help and punishment does not exist .
both are necessary if the problem is to be tackled truly effectively .
the swedish model seems to me the most successful one at present .
throughout the debate today , and indeed on other occasions , i have heard no convincing argument against the swedish model , and i see no reason why it should not be a model for europe as a whole .
in the light of that , i am also irritated by the debate between my country - germany - and the netherlands .
our foreign minister , mr kinkel , said recently in the hague that nobody wished to interfere in the drugs policy of the netherlands , but the german government as a whole takes a different view .
i wonder whether mr kinkel has forgotten that we are in the third year after maastricht .
the dialogue about combating drugs is not interference : it is european domestic policy .
to my mind , the third point is of particular importance .
mr president , i first of all thank all those who have contributed in such a sincere and dedicated way .
obviously it is a debate that touches a lot of people 's concerns in the house .
the text before you today for this second reading is the council 's common position on the first programme for community action to prevent drug dependence .
we all agree on the need for such a programme and the need to adopt concrete measures to combat drug abuse at european level .
as you know , the initial proposal has been extended following the incorporation of some 21 amendments which were proposed by parliament and which were supported by the commission either fully or partially .
the council took on board many of the amendments , sometimes , i have to say , in a different form .
i believe that considerable progress has been made in arriving at a text which is acceptable to all the community institutions .
i accept that there is need for some further work to be done so that we can resolve the differences that exist .
for its part the commission could not accept the council 's common position for two principal reasons .
they have both been referred to here .
the council wants to reduce the overall budget for the five-year programme from ecu 28.5m to ecu 27m .
the commission finds this unacceptable given that the common position which has been suggested by the council substantially extends the scope of the original proposal .
it wants to extend the scope and still reduce the money .
we find that unacceptable .
secondly , the management committee , a structure which is proposed by the council , is inappropriate for such a very small-sized programme .
the commission supports the setting up of a purely advisory committee , both as a matter of principle and in order to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens .
i remain of that view , notwithstanding the decisions taken on the committee structure for the three other health programmes recently approved under the codecision procedure .
i would like to turn to the commission 's position on the 32 amendments proposed by the rapporteur in the second reading .
twelve are acceptable to the commission , mr burtone , fully or in part .
these are nos 3 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 26 , 27 , 28 and 31 .
amendment no 4 : this statement is already covered by recital 1 of the common position and by amendment no 6 .
amendment no 5 : amendment no 7 describes the objectives of the programme in greater detail without reference to the objectives of a policy on drugs .
amendment no 6 : the first statement is fully acceptable since it confirms the public health approach to the scourge but the second part falls outside the community powers under article 129 .
amendment no 9 is already covered by amendment no 7 .
amendment no 13 : the content of this amendment is covered by amendment no 15 which is acceptable to the commission .
amendment no 18 : the tasks of the emcdda are dealt with in the regulation establishing it and it cannot be modified through this programme .
amendments nos 19 , 20 and 21 : i have already underlined the commission 's position concerning the nature of the committee foreseen by article 5 of the proposed decision .
furthermore , i would like to point out that amendments nos 19 and 21 are not in the line with the decisions taken by the three health programmes that were adopted at the beginning of this year .
amendments nos 22 and 37 : the activities foreseen in these amendments are not in line with the principle of subsidiarity and would exceed the budgetary possibilities of the programme .
amendment no 23 : the commission was supportive of the evaluation and exchange of experience in the fields mentioned in the amendment and this has been incorporated into the common position .
amendment no 24 : the commission considered that these activities are already included in the common position under generic provisions .
amendment no 29 : the prevention of drug dependence and associated risks with the support of the activities of relevant bodies is the main aim of the programme and it is already underlined in the council text .
so , having reviewed these various amendments , i would again like to express my appreciation for the work of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
i hope that the adoption of this programme will in due course support , relaunch and act as a catalyst for common efforts to prevent drug dependence and to help drug users .
mr president , i wish to speak briefly to express , certainly , my appreciation for the efforts made by the commissioner to align the commission position and that of the house .
but significant differences remain , both with the commission and with those who have tabled amendments on behalf , among others , of the epp , the effect of which is to distort the work done so far .
i repeat : we have taken a consistent line , a far from easy path ; at any rate , we have tried to respond to a tragic problem - the problem of drug dependence in europe .
those are the approaches we stressed in the difficult debate held in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection and , subsequently , in the house .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
votes
madam president , we would like a separate vote on amendments nos 5 and 6 .
madam president , i was under the impression that we had agreed that if we wanted a separate vote on anything , we had to say so in advance .
i naturally agree with mr pompidou , but i think we have to be consistent , otherwise we cannot carry on .
mrs oomen-ruijten , you are perfectly right in the case when there is a recommendation from the committee responsible .
that is why i initially stated that there had not been any recommendation from the committee responsible in the case of these amendments .
there is not therefore any problem .
excuse me for intervening once again , madam president , but we also want a separate vote on amendments nos 22 and 23 .
( the president declared the common position adopted as amended )
i should like a separate vote on amendment no 16 , madam president .
mrs oomen-ruijten , on this occasion the committee responsible has recommended a block vote on amendments nos 12 , 16 , 19 , 21 .
furthermore , your request for a separate vote does not seem to have reached us before the deadline laid down by rule 116 .
i am sure you will understand the difficult situation this puts me in .
we did everything according to the rules , madam president .
mrs oomen-ruijten , as you were able to appreciate this morning , we are introducing a system which is , let us say , rather more constraining and rigid than we are used to .
i believe we should be pragmatic and allow ourselves a certain flexibility in moving towards the strict application of this system , as we are not voting machines .
this is why i am going to allow a separate vote on amendment no 16 .
when you are president mr anastassopoulos , you will be perfectly free to be as inflexible as you like .
for the sake of fairness , madam president , if we have a sperate vote on amendment no 16 , we request the same for amendments nos 19 and 21 .
mr pompidou , you are seeking to shamelessly profit from the situation !
no , madam president , it is in the interests of consistency .
i am sure , mr pompidou , that you will withdraw this request which was made in order to inject a little humour into the vote .
no , madam president , my group is with me .
i cannot decide alone to withdraw this request .
( the president declared the common position adopted as amended )
madam president , i wanted to say a word on this point as i once again presented the table which failed by just one vote to win the commission 's support .
but i should like to draw attention to the fact that having approved the previous text we will be contradicting ourselves if we do not adopt the amendment which i propose .
yesterday commissioner papoutsis , who was here , demonstrated the coherence between the text we have just adopted and the table i propose .
this is why i invite you to vote in favour of my amendment , especially as the commission and parliament must succeed in convincing the council .
madam president , i should like to support the amendment .
i do not think there is any contradiction here .
the committee approved the table unanimously because , in the table , priorities are established very clearly , perhaps more clearly than in the broader brush-strokes of the text .
as i said , however , there is no contradiction here , and the committee approved this table unanimously .
thank you sir .
the house is sufficiently well-informed to vote in full knowledge of the facts .
after the adoption of the ' table ' part of amendment no 27 :
madam president , the table i referred to was , of course , that of the committee , not the table submitted by mr soulier and the ppe .
it is really quite straightforward , because the committee presented and approved this table , not the one that was submitted by the ppe .
i would therefore ask that the vote be retaken , because what i said clearly created some confusion .
so to recap and to make it quite clear : the committee 's table is not the same as that of the ppe .
mr lange , i believe that there is in effect some confusion .
i believe that for my part i have been very clear .
i put to the vote amendment no 27 by the european people 's party .
the rapporteur then requested to speak in order to explain why he was in favour of this amendment and why he had tabled it .
you spoke giving the impression that you supported it , but that is your affair .
this amendment was put to the vote once again and i made it quite clear which one we were dealing with .
we will not be taking this vote again .
that would not be right .
i believe that everything was very clear .
i should like to protest .
it is indeed normal for a rapporteur to speak on behalf of the committee .
but in this case we were misled for the simple reason that the rapporteur did not speak on behalf of his committee , but on behalf of his group .
that is not at all normal .
mr dankert , i listened carefully to the rapporteur , especially as he spoke in my language so there was no possible interpreting error .
i most definitely did not hear mr soulier refer to the ppe group .
i was really very attentive and i tell you this quite simply .
we will not be taking this vote again , it would not be right to do so .
everything was very clear .
i should simply like to say this , madam president .
on this basis , it was therefore preferable to support amendment no 27 by mr soulier rather than to maintain amendment no 26 by our committee on research , technological development and energy .
i assure members of my group that everything was conducted properly .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
there has been no movement on the thermie programme , a programme on renewable energy , which is being held up by the council .
it is therefore all the more important that we , as a parliament , get it implemented and make the council and the commission put their money where their mouth is .
otherwise , we in the eu will gradually become a laughing stock !
i would not go so far as to call us liars , but absolutely nothing is happening !
high-sounding words about the need for energy efficiency and co2 reduction are being bandied about , but nothing is being done !
it is all hot air .
otherwise , we shall make problems when it comes to the budget .
the proposal for a council decision concerns an exceptionally important area for the union 's member states in terms of the economy , the environment and supply policy : the promotion of energy efficiency .
it is vital , therefore , to extend the save programme for a new five-year period with a view to a more rational use of our scarce resources .
there is no point in not legislating in this area - on grounds of the principle of subsidiarity - in view of the cross-border nature of the problems associated with co2 .
recommendation for second reading by mr von wogau
we assume that the customs 2000 programme is concerned with agreeing at community level criteria for the minimum level of the controls to be carried out .
since the various member states today have different legislation governing such subjects as drugs and arms control we do not consider that it will be possible to arrive at a common interpretation of the powers of customs authorities .
in our opinion each member state should itself be allowed to decide on the level of controls to be carried out at its borders with other eu countries .
we are therefore very pleased today , at second reading , to see that the council has since taken the same line as ourselves and rejected parliament 's most contestable amendments .
as could have been expected , the european parliament has returned to the attack with amendments which my group voted against .
now , under the pretext of improving external controls , the proposal is to move towards ' communitization ' .
this is to make another mistake , and for three reasons .
i approve of parliament 's insistence in giving the community ' customs 2000 ' programme more force and substance faced with the hesitations of the co-legislator , the council .
the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy thus wants to step up the fight against fraud through harmonized and reinforced customs .
in the face of third parties , common tariffs must be matched with common customs .
this means imposing strict rules everywhere where there are customs , and not rules which vary from one member state to another .
such a programme can encourage the european union to advance in this direction , but we must of course show we are serious in implementing the programme , in particular when it comes to the controls .
each member state must provide its customs with the technical and human resources necessary to fulfill this task .
i stress in particular the importance of continuing high-level training supplementing the initial training which each customs officer receives in his country of origin .
this continuing training , to be given at a european customs academy , will be a vital asset for european customs officers working at external borders and involved in the fight against fraud .
we have voted today against almost all the amendments to the community action programme ' customs 2000 ' , since we believe that they do not respect the individual member states ' sovereignty .
it should still be up to each member state to decide how they wish to control their borders , train their personnel , etc .
practically all the member states have different laws on the importation of different kinds of goods , e.g. drugs and arms .
that is the way it should be in the future as well , and that is why we see no grounds for harmonizing legislation in this area .
the european parliament has now approved , at second reading , its definitive version of the ' customs 2000 ' action programme .
i hope that , as the next step , the council of ministers will signal its acceptance of the following important proposals from parliament :
drug abuse is one of the worst scourges with which europe has to contend .
it is therefore also extremely important that strategies for combating drugs are chosen with care .
we are of the opinion that the proposals put forward in the burtone report are geared too much to measures to reduce the harm caused by existing abuse .
we believe this is far too late .
greater emphasis ought to be placed on preventive work , particularly among young people .
we know that the fewer the young people who try drugs in the first place , the smaller the number who later become addicted .
we also believe that it is wrong to make a distinction between hard and soft drugs or between use and abuse .
the problem of where the line should be drawn will always arise and any ambiguity about what is acceptable and what is not will only send mixed signals to our children and young people .
a drugs policy aimed at restriction and prevention is the common path we ought to take , in order to be able to combat drugs effectively .
resignation and an ever increasing level of tolerance will only have the opposite effect .
the drug abuse issue is at heart a question of democracy and human rights : all men and women should have control over their own bodies .
a person dependent on drugs can never be free to exercise such control .
it is highly regrettable that the council does not have a point of view to match the scale of the problem of drug dependence and the essential need for prevention .
there must be no holds barred when it comes to combatting the drug dealers , those peddlers of death , and those who specialize in laundering drug money , the financiers behind organized death .
drug addicts must be saved from these people .
they must be cared for and allowed to benefit from the widest possible prevention , one which certainly includes a genuine european health programme but which also extends to other community policies .
the council must accept the cooperation which must be implemented .
the council must see drug addicts as people in distress who must be brought back into society and not as delinquents .
consequently ( and this is a long-term goal ) , we must first give drug addicts the means to avoid the spread of risks linked to drug consumption .
we cannot rescue them from their dependence overnight .
also , together with prevention pure and simple , which is a means of avoiding the use of drugs , we must protect addicts from the still greater risks they run .
i therefore fully support the burtone report , which we must adopt with a very large majority .
i hope that the commission will support our approach .
i invite the council to show greater realism and commitment in implementing this programme .
its very credibility is at stake .
what upsets me and greatly concerns many swedish people and other europeans is the tenor of the amendments tabled by mr burtone and the committee .
certainly it is important to help drug addicts .
it is at least equally important , however , to prevent young people and others being drawn into drug abuse .
clear signals are needed from the authorities of european states .
this is why i voted against central elements of the burtone report .
the fact that i have abstained from voting in favour of the report on the prevention of drugs , does not mean that i am not in favour of preventing the drug problem .
i am , to the greatest possible extent .
however it is precisely prevention of , as opposed to combating , this serious problem which is best undertaken at national state level .
the states themselves are best able to assess which policy and what resources in their particular circumstances - including cultural norms - will produce optimal results .
earlier , the burtone report caused considerable conflict between the majority , who are liberal on drugs , and most of the swedish members .
in the proposal which has now been adopted some of the proposals from those who are liberal on drugs have been removed .
it has also been established that it ' is not advisable to draw a sharp distinction between soft and hard drugs ' .
does this mean that the information provided by sweden has had an effect ?
this is possible and , if true , it is hopeful sign .
the report still contains a number of elements which the environmental party cannot support :
on the contrary , it is only if we tackle and reduce drugs dependence with enough political will and sufficient means that we will actually be able to attack this problem from every aspect .
the consumption of various kinds of drugs , including so-called hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine , has assumed dramatic proportions over the last 20 years .
it is not surprising therefore that many eu citizens today regard drug abuse as one of the greatest of all social problems .
nor can there be any doubt that this cross-border problem must , and will , be solved by means of a combination of national and international measures .
in this light there is every reason to welcome the commission 's proposal for a programme of action for the prevention of drug abuse .
i fully support these proposals to improve the community 's programme of action .
recommendation for second reading by mr castricum
the proposed interoperability of the transeuropean high-speed rail system is a good project .
but it only has any meaning if it is accompanied by a financial plan allowing europe to complete the efforts made by the individual member states .
we must apply the principle of subsidiarity and too often the european union intervenes illegitimately in matters which are normally within the sphere of competence of the member states .
but in this particular case it is surprising that the european union is not pledging major financial support for this ultimate transborder project .
let me take the example of the east high-speed rail link , running from paris to strasbourg , vienna and budapest . in addition to the efforts of the member states , this project also needs community funding .
the european union should redirect its efforts at genuine transborder projects .
taken overall , this would not increase expenditure but rather reduce it .
i should like to see a financial report one day complement the present report .
i believe there is an urgent need for this .
recommendation for second reading by mr cornelissen
i consequently welcome the work done in this report , to tighten up the regulations , and i am therefore able to support the report .
soulier report
total world consumption of energy is increasing , particularly in the developing countries .
unfortunately , this increase in consumption will primarily take the form of greater use of fossil fuels , increasing emissions of co2 into the atmosphere as a result .
in order to militate against this trend as much as possible , it is of paramount importance that the eu continues and intensifies its transfer of know-how in the energy sector to the developing countries .
as a step towards this end the eu should , for example , make all the useful data and experience gained from the eu save ii programme available to the developing countries .
soltwedel-sch&auml;fer report
madam president , the report by mrs soltwedel-sch&auml;fer is full of comments and proposals which show both good sense and goodwill .
however , certain points are unacceptable .
first of all , we completely rule out even a partial standardization of the social protection systems of the member states ( in order to harmonize the reimbursement amounts for medicines ) .
secondly , you must be careful when promoting so-called generic medicines .
thirdly , we are highly suspicious of the praise of self-medication .
this opens the door to all kinds of abuses and dangers .
we must never forget that medicines are an active product which must be treated with care .
we must therefore never lose sight of the all-important role of the pharmacist and physician in terms of information and control and not seek to sacrifice this at the altar of illfounded economic arguments .
the most important consideration in all of this must be public health .
despite these major reservations , we voted in favour of this report .
community guidelines for an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry must take account of the fact that the trade in medicines does not take place under normal market conditions .
it is not an invisible hand which determines demand , supply and price , it is the representatives of interest groups and government authorities which exercise a considerable influence over sales , consumption and profits .
this has a number of consequences .
' pharmacon ' means both medicine and poison , something healing and something deadly .
it goes without saying that you cannot obtain goods of this kind freely , nor can you supply them unsupervised .
we can also understand why the state , the health insurance funds , patients ' associations , doctors ' organizations , universities and the pharmaceutical sector are all involved in the creation and distribution of medicines .
the european union 's interest , and particularly that of the european parliament , lies in both the industrial and public health aspects .
as a member of the two committees asked for their opinion , i agree with the draft proposal in principle .
it is a sensible and balanced compromise between the different interests of the pharmaceutical industry , social security , research organizations , the health insurance funds , the medical profession and consumers ' organizations .
i do feel , however , that we need a clear definition of innovations .
a real innovation is a new medicine , not an existing medicine that is given a new description or a ' me too ' medicine which is brought out as a derivative years after a genuine innovation .
a real innovation is used to cure previously incurable or untreatable diseases and conditions , or offers better treatment for certain complaints or a better chance of curing them than existing medicines .
all in all , i feel that this proposal is a step in the right direction .
a policy on pharmaceuticals must take account of the competitiveness and profitability of the sector as a whole - industrial policy - and of employment , public health , medical progress and social security - social policy .
i believe that the proposal on which we are to vote meets all the requirements of sound policy , both industrial and social .
that concludes voting time .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
discharge for 1991 , 1992 , 1993 and 1994
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , i would not have objected to my danish colleague , eva kjer , speaking first .
what we are talking about here is 60 billion danish kroner .
this year the coal and steel union is the only body to have been awarded an unconditional statement of assurance , and that is incredibly good .
i would , however , like to start by congratulating the commission on the fact that the bagnoli case is now finally concluded .
for four years i have protested about a ten-year-old matter concerning the missing interest payments which the italians tried to cheat us out of .
the commission has succeeded in recovering this money .
it is a couple of million danish kroner , but it is something at least , as taxpayers will understand , that money which had been paid out unlawfully , has been repaid .
we should almost put the flags out to celebrate the fact that , on 11 october 1995 , the commission was finally able to resolve this matter .
but then we begin to have some of the minor points we have problems with . the solvency ratios .
we adopted a directive in 1992 , and now we are even contravening the actual solvency ratio directive .
that is to say that we have excessive external investments .
the key factor is risk spreading , and it is being confined to fewer and fewer debtors and bigger and bigger commitments .
i can quote a couple of figures . there are 11 debtors whose loans exceed 25 % of the ecsc 's net assets .
the main commitments exceed 800 % of net assets , which means that the risk is not sufficiently spread .
we may run the risk of some momentous events occurring whereby we suddenly sustain some losses , but perhaps we are running over into next year 's discharge procedure now .
but what if , for example , we are involved in a bankruptcy in connection with the tunnel between france and england ?
then the eu system loses - and wait for it everybody - over 10 billion danish kroner , and that is when things start to get problematic .
that is to say , therefore , that even if the accounts have been properly kept , there have still been shortcomings .
that is one of the things i am really aware of , and i have asked for a list of the types of guarantees we have .
i have been promised it by the commission , but have not yet received it .
we do not seem to be very good at speculating in securities either .
now we shall have to wait until the market changes and the rate goes up to recover the money .
let us look at another problem , for example the paris affair .
we have covered it up here in the accounts .
28 % of the investments which should have been paid back to the ecsc have not been received , and that amounts to ecu 1.68 million .
that means that the figures are being massaged , and i would therefore ask the commission to sort things out and stop using all these tricks to hide the figures .
i also wonder , in regard to all the properties we have at our 126 embassies around the world , whether the accounts have been tampered with there as well ?
these are some of the things which i , at any rate , will try to investigate when we get to next year 's discharge .
they have had god knows how many million kroner in interest allowances and , according to the commission 's legal service , we have no chance of recovering them .
in short , the commission should be brave and take a political step to get the money back .
finally , mr president , england has received over 50 % of the loans earmarked for four countries .
we cannot have that .
it is interesting when an english government does this .
prime minister major is behaving like a flirtatious woman ; asking all and giving nothing .
he may well like our money , but he does not like the eu .
i call upon mrs theato to speak on a point of order .
mr president , i did not quite understand why the order of the reports was changed .
i was told that the president-in-office would attend our debate and hear at least the first reports .
i would greatly appreciate your confirmation on this point .
my fear is that we will waste time by making further changes and failing to adhere to the agreed timetable .
the order was changed , mrs theato , solely because mr blak had important business preventing him from attending later .
all the other reports will be dealt with in the order envisaged .
the council will be able to speak , but it seems that there is some delay because of the trialogue which is taking place .
i call upon mr tomlinson for a point of order .
mr president , following on from the question that mrs theato has raised , the council itself fixed the time for the trialogue .
so it has deliberately double-booked itself .
to be in another room having the trialogue while the debate on discharge is taking place in this house is unacceptable conduct .
the council fixed the trialogue .
it determined when it was going to be .
it decided that in this debate , which rests on its recommendation , it can waltz in here whenever it wants and make its speech without having heard the debate .
i hope therefore , mr president , that you will consider denying the floor to the council when it arrives , because it has treated this house with disdain and contempt .
we should show it the same .
mr president , i am astonished that we are holding this debate on the discharge without having the commission here .
how can we expect people to take parliament seriously if it operates like this ?
i have been an elected representative for 25 years , but i have never experienced anything like this .
will you arrange for a representative of the commission to come here without delay ?
it is quite impossible to proceed with the discharge debate under these circumstances .
mr president , on the same point .
i was just going to make the move for adjournment and i am supported by a large number of members from all round the house .
mr president , i have just come from the trialogue and commissioner liikanen is indeed tied up there as is the president-in-office .
we left here when voting finished at 1 p.m. , went directly to the trialogue and for approximately 45 minutes the trialogue has been adjourned so that the presidency can sort itself out .
the way it has tried to conduct the meeting during the last two hours has been an absolute disgrace . i cannot see an end to it within the next two hours .
i do not know if the room is booked . i have come out because i have two reports on the agenda .
but you have a problem , mr president .
perhaps someone can get some information from the meeting room as to when they expect to be finished . that would help members considerably .
mr wynn , ladies and gentlemen , i shall suspend the sitting for ten minutes .
i have sent someone to ask whether after these ten minutes we can expect the council and the commission .
if the council and the commission say they cannot guarantee to be here in ten minutes , i shall put it to the vote whether or not we should continue with the debate .
( the sitting was suspended at 3.10 p.m. and resumed at 3.20 p.m. )
ladies and gentlemen , i have been in contact with the commission and the council .
the commissioner has been kind enough to come straight away .
as regards the council , we are told that they are discussing a document at the moment and will be another quarter of an hour .
i therefore put to the vote the question whether the debate should continue .
( parliament decided to continue with the debate )
mr president , i warn in advance that god help the council if it comes in here wanting to lecture us for half an hour on a debate it has not heard .
i hope you make that abundantly clear to the president-in-office before he walks into this room .
we were treated with disdain in committee when we were sent a civil servant to give what after all is a political recommendation .
we made it quite clear in committee that was unacceptable conduct by the presidency .
we have been treated with contempt again this afternoon and what we will not put up with is some sort of lecture on a debate which the council has not had the courtesy to listen to .
i hope the representative of the council can make that quite clear to the presidency before it comes to the chamber .
it will save some of us the embarrassment of having to say it again directly to the council when it arrives .
thank you , mr tomlinson .
the council has a distinguished representative here who will naturally report these points of view .
you know that it is not for me to censor what the council wishes to say in this assembly and you will receive the appropriate answers in parliamentary terms .
i therefore call upon the rapporteur , mrs kjer hansen , to present her report .
the agricultural policy has become so complex that it must be radically simplified and reformed before the accounts can be closed efficiently .
i hope that message will be an important consideration in any discussion of future agricultural policy .
it is also a problem that agricultural expenditure is paid via the eu budget only .
naturally , the member states do not , therefore , have the same interest in exposing irregular payments which may have taken place .
it is quite simply a clash of interests between the commission and the member states in that expenditure is not shared .
the procedure for closing the accounts is far from satisfactory for several reasons .
the commission does not have sufficient resources to carry out the procedure satisfactorily .
the scope of the audit is minimal compared with the transactions made .
there are areas where no checks have been made whatsoever for years .
it is also difficult to carry out proper checks owing to the large numbers of bodies involved in paying out funds in the member states .
in many cases it seems to be pure guesswork as to what sums are to be collected .
only 7 % of the corrections made in the 1991 budget are individual corrections .
the rest are ' standard ' corrections , i.e. the commission estimates or , more correctly , guesses what sums or what percentages are to be recovered .
the member states accept the corrections in the majority of cases , but we have also seen a number of examples of disagreements which have then been brought before the court .
i therefore welcome the fact that a conciliation board has been set up to enable the member states and the commission to enter into conciliation in the event of a dispute .
the critical problem with the procedure for closing the accounts is that what should have been a technical procedure has , in reality , become a political negotiation .
the assessment which the commission makes is made the subject of negotiation between the commission and the member state in question .
we have seen a number of examples of this .
of course , both good and bad things might be said about such negotiations , but the fact is that there is no question of objectivity .
another well-known example is the milk quota affair .
we have previously discussed this in great detail , but allow me to emphasize all the same that negotiation and political pressure predominated over the fact that there was a case of an unlawfully paid sum .
the whole matter ended up as political horsetrading , and the best that can be said about the milk quota affair is that the public got to hear all about it as it unfolded .
the fact that there is often negotiation between the commission and a member state means that the law is not necesseraly upheld .
the risk that the member states are not given the same treatment exists , whether it occurs consciously or is merely a reflection of accidental discrimination .
of course there are other member states which find this so-called flexibility quite acceptable , because they believe it could be in their interests .
the problem is , however , that the idea behind the closure of the accounts is to recover expenditure not actually entitled to support .
the system suffers from numerous failings and the most serious is that it does not ensure , and does not seek to ensure , objectivity in closing the accounts , so that the amounts recovered reflect actual losses .
i recommend that discharge be given for this area , not because it deserves to be , but because it is the natural thing to do if we are to be consistent and follow up an earlier decision .
mr president , the discharge for the 1992 budget has caused something of a stir .
could i ask the commissioner how much of the ecu 1.6 million has now been paid ?
a few points were left over at the end of the discharge debate last year , such as the inquiry into tobacco fraud in greece and italy .
am i right in thinking that very little work has been done on the investigation in greece ?
when will parliament be informed about the probable scale of the fraud and the measures that have been taken ?
does the commission share my view that this is hardly what one could call sound financial management ?
finally , there was the failure to recover ecu 170 m from spain for the nonapplication of milk quotas in 1989 .
this is an extremely serious matter .
it means that the commission makes the application of the treaty and the principle of equal treatment conditional on a protest from one or more of the member states .
i realize that most of these decisions were taken by the previous commission , but i insist on having a clear explanation from the present one .
the handling of the issue of funding for slaughtering calves in the netherlands is further undermining the credibility of the commission 's financial policy .
i know that the commission is to make a statement tomorrow , but perhaps the commissioner responsible for the budget and budget control could say something now about this ' spend , spend , spend ' approach .
let me explain what i mean .
i think this is an extremely serious matter which undermines the credibility of the entire commission .
can the commissioner explain how this is supposed to be consistent with the strict financial management which mr santer announced , and on which i congratulated him ?
after all , the proof of the pudding is in the eating , as they say , so i would like a detailed reply from the commission on this fundamental question .
mr president , these eight reports for joint debate represent something rather new in the community this year because the maastricht treaty instructs the court to produce a statement of assurance each year on the community 's finances .
it does not tell the court how to do it nor does it tell parliament what to do with it .
i was preparing to follow mr wynn with my remarks and now i find that i am playing st john before him !
the court devoted considerable resources to the das ( statement of assurance ) and that fact is obvious when you see the shortcomings or look for the holes in the annual report for 1994 .
i look to the new president of the court to bring about a restructuring of the working methods of the court .
i asked for that last year and i ask for it again because we need to see the court so organized that it can actually produce an annual report and the statement of assurance .
this leaves it , i know , hard pressed but if it acted more like an international firm of auditors and rather less like a pale copy of the european commission , it might be more successful .
the second problem follows the receipt of the das by the european parliament .
this has led to considerable discussion in the committee on budgetary control .
i strongly support the answers provided by mr wynn , which he will give later and which can be found in his explanatory statement .
he sets the das and the constitutional position of das in its proper context because all the european council did was just request that the court produce the statement .
it did not say how the court should do it and it did not say what we should do with it .
now my friend mr blak has had to depart .
it is a matter of breaking the windows and running away .
last year i said about him ' i regard him as the man in charge of the european coal and steel community .
he does a splendid job . '
however , with his remarks about the closure of coalmines , he has allowed his party politics to get the better of his normally sound judgment .
he is at it again this year !
it is true to say that he makes it clear the united kingdom has not acted illegally .
there has been no question of deliberate wastage of european coal and steel community funds .
while one of the mines was closed in 1990 , the markham main colliery has been mothballed , in that it is under repair and maintenance so that it can be used in the future .
we shall vote against his paragraph 11 .
if i may turn to dublin , that is a fairly easy task because the committee on budgetary control has no hesitation in recommending that discharge be given for the 1994 year .
i am delighted that it has been reported that the saga about property in dublin is at an end. this has gone on far too long and that worry is now behind us .
but the problem of financial control at dublin is not yet settled .
we recommended last year that the commission appoint a part-timer to carry out this work and this has not yet been done .
the pattern of work , the financial regulation and the court 's advice seem to conspire to produce too much cash in hand at any one time .
if the court , the commission and the foundation cannot get it right , they should propose an amendment to the financial regulation because the advice conflicts from year to year .
i hope that the house will endorse the committee on budgetary control 's recommendation that discharge for the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions in dublin be granted .
it is not such an easy story when we turn to the european centre for the development of vocational training , cedefop as we call it ; there are much more serious problems there .
i hasten to add that the problems are not mainly of the centre 's making - they are not its fault at all .
it must have been a prime instance of european cock-up theory which prompted the european council to transfer cedefop from berlin to thessaloniki .
i really believe that it was their intention to transfer the east european training foundation - who were temporary tenants of cedefop in berlin - to thessaloniki .
but as the king had spoken , the move had to take place .
the commission did not help because it indulged in some appalling labour relations so that more than half of the staff were not prepared to move .
i do not think parliament helped either because we had asked for independent consultants to come in and review the work of cedefop .
they chose to come in just at the time when morale was under the floorboards because the staff were not happy with the arrangements that were being made .
the court produced a fairly critical report on this point , but the consultants went so far as to suggest that the centre was not a great deal of use to the community .
i do not think the committee on budgetary control is the right body to make a qualitative assessment as to the centre 's usefulness and future use .
that is the work for the spending committee .
my view is that as long as there is a growing demand for the centre 's reports they must be doing some useful research which people want to get hold of .
that is a good commercial justification .
that work deserves an even higher priority .
rather than condemn cedefop out of hand by refusing discharge , we propose that discharge should be deferred .
the budgetary control committee recommends to the house that we defer discharge to cedefop for the time being .
i finish with an appeal to the commission and everybody else concerned to look at what is happening to the management boards for both dublin and thessaloniki .
there are now more people on the management boards than there are people working in the centre .
the founding fathers ' original idea was to get the social partners to talk together - that is a good thing - government , employers and trade unions .
but if you have one representative from each of the 15 member states and the efta countries and representatives from the commission , you have got boards of 60 people .
they meet twice and their bureau meets three or four times .
there must be a better way of doing it which would look more sensible to europe 's citizens .
i appeal to the commission to instigate an enquiry as to how this can be improved .
if that applies to the past , then we also welcome the sem 2000 proposals and hope that in the future things will be far better .
the problem when we give discharge is the fact that 80 % of the union 's budget is spent by the member states , and we all know this .
unfortunately , we do not give discharge to the member states , we only give discharge to the commission .
a lot of the specific subject areas within the report will be covered by people who follow me .
i just want to concentrate on one issue and one issue only , which has been referred to by mr kellett-bowman , and that is the das .
the das will enhance the sound financial management of the community 's budget - we all accept that - but there are problems , as the court of auditors indicated .
we asked it to specify individual cases and sub-totals based on substantial errors reported by the court ; then we asked it to inform parliament of the action taken in both cases .
so we await the commission 's response on that .
this was the first statement of assurance .
the results of the court of auditors ' report on the commission were somewhat mixed .
it was blazoned all over the media that the community was misspending or losing - of course , the word ' fraud ' cropped up time and time again - 4 % of our budget .
we have to take that on board and we have to decide whether we can give discharge to the commission in the light of what was said in the das statement .
let us just look at it .
the one thing that we have to remember is that discharge is the legal certification of the accounts .
when we look at this 4 % we have to ask the question : well , is this an acceptable level or a non-acceptable level ?
the simple answer is that it is a non-acceptable level !
parliament in no way can condone this 4 % figure .
so we cannot accept that one ecu in every 25 is wrongly paid .
but then you have to look at the system itself and you have to ask questions such as : is the figure reliable ?
that depends on which angle you look at it from !
you will find that discussed in the explanatory statement , where we ask whether the figure is reliable .
but if it is reliable , then whose fault is it ?
that is an even bigger dilemma .
in the main , we could blame the member states , because they are the ones who spend this 80 % of the budget .
but , of course , as i said , we do not give discharge to the member states .
the thing we should asking is : can those errors be corrected ?
let us be perfectly clear that parliament cannot legally establish a debt .
we cannot do the job of the commission .
therefore , we cannot make the recovery of the money a condition of discharge .
that is of fundamental importance .
parliament 's discharge power is focussed on the community 's accounts .
this is the area where , of course , we can act .
if the accounts were amended , as we request in paragraph 8 , to include the sums the commission hopes to recover , then three things would happen .
therefore , the conclusions reached in that general report are that we should grant discharge subject to these demands on the commission .
i now turn to the european development fund .
here the recommendation is greatly different .
there comes a time when we have to say enough is enough .
quite frankly , there are three things that have come to a head and which have now brought us to the stage where we say enough is enough .
we have said for a long time that the edf does not give the correct democratic accountability and that it is compromised by its legal and financial framework .
within this report and within the resolution parliament recognizes the commission 's attempt to improve the edf through its better financial management , even working within what we consider to be an impossible framework .
there is no criticism of the commission on the edf in general .
but the das gave us the opportunity to look at the accounts , and the court of auditors said that the accounts imperfectly reflect the financial situation and the operations of the edfs .
they lack the consistency and discipline to be able to reflect the true situation faithfully .
that is clearly not a positive statement of assurance .
dg viii of the commission would argue that it is .
that was once again our dilemma where we acted as the referee and in doing so the one thing we are clear about is that it is not a positive statement .
as i said about the general budget , it is there as a tool to help parliament .
it is member state expenditure which is managed by the commission .
in other words , the commission acts as a sub-contractor to manage these funds and to all intents and purposes parliament has no say in this expenditure .
yet we are obliged to give discharge .
we respect the court of justice ruling but it creates a confused and incoherent mess .
it also creates problems for the day-to-day management of the edfs .
if we want to give a discharge year in and year out , we would want to know where we stand legally to do so .
the commission has made great strides to change things and we accept that and welcome it .
that is the only way the system can change .
we also recognize with the current system that the commission staff in brussels is not sufficient , not in quality but in numbers .
it does not have enough staff to do what it should be doing at present .
the nature of the commission 's role as regards development funding gives rise to contradictions that parliament as a democratic institution finds extremely hard to accept .
member states take the credit for providing the funds .
they write the rule book - such as it is - but they then leave the commission and parliament to take the blame .
so there are two aspects which i have named so far .
firstly. the das and , secondly , the court of justice ruling .
the third aspect was what happened at the cultural foundation .
there should be no excuses whatsoever from the commission .
when i met the commission it would have been nice for them to have said : ' it 's a fair cop , guv ' nor .
we hold our hands up , we were wrong ' .
but a defence was put up in certain quarters and i find that quite inexplicable .
when something is as bad as what happened with the cultural foundation , we should not try to cover it up .
the commission took a political decision which it did not have to do even if the council of ministers was leaning upon it to do so .
in no way , shape or form should parliament be connected with that decision .
if we had not had the das or the court of justice ruling , i for one would have been recommending that we do not give discharge because of what happened with the cultural foundation .
from now on we have to look at it through different eyes and for the year 1994 the recommendation is refusal of discharge .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as a parliament we have a different task from that of the court of auditors .
our task is to make a political assessment of what the budget reveals about policy .
in the area of social policy , it reveals a gulf between the requirements , in terms of european social policy , and the european social policy that exists .
that comes across very clearly .
it is then further reflected in individual structural problems .
if we grant a discharge , we must recognize , on the one hand , that although european social policy is needed , it is not being practised .
however , we must also ask ourselves - and i would explicitly endorse what mr wynn said on this point - who is responsible in each instance .
if we cannot manage to curb this behaviour on the part of the member states , there is something strange about criticizing the commission and refusing to grant it discharge .
we must , therefore , grant discharge to the commission , because we have succeeded in establishing to our satisfaction that it is not the commission that is at fault here .
mr president , it is our job to monitor the efficiency of development aid and to exercise control , in our own political interest and the interest of the taxpayer .
it is perhaps worth noting that all this aid would not be needed if we had a fair system of trade , and were prepared to cancel debts .
in many cases , there are no written reports on these matters .
the commission should not rely too heavily on the implementing authorities or firms to provide effective monitoring .
this problem with the cultural foundation is a scandal , but it is already two years old .
we in parliament have brought the scandal to light , and set the wheels in motion to have it discussed .
i think we can fairly say that it is being dealt with .
if we do not grant this discharge , we may spark off a fresh debate about lom&eacute; iv and financing .
we have just been involved in major controversy with the council about these issues .
i find a great deal to criticize in lom&eacute; iv too , but we are talking here about the only forum for north-south dialogue .
this political dialogue has to be important to us .
therefore , we should not see it destroyed because of this one instance .
it is important that this issue should be discussed at the intergovernmental conference .
we must make the inclusion of the development fund in the budget a political issue at the conference .
that is our demand .
we should use this budget discharge as an occasion to exert pressure on the national governments .
mr wolf has just said that we must place a share of the responsibility on the national governments .
that is what we must do .
it is my belief that if we proceed by making an example of this scandal , the effect we produce will be disproportionate to our analysis .
that means that the fund must be budgetized .
it might then be possible to resolve scandals and problems such as these by other means .
mr president , i would like , first of all , to congratulate all the rapporteurs on these many reports and say that in each case i will be following the rapporteur 's recommendation .
it reflects the work they have done to get consensus for their reports .
i want to use my limited time to talk politically about the process that we are going through .
the commission 's attitude is welcome .
quite clearly the culture in the commission has changed and is improving .
i hope it will continue to improve until we have the sort of culture that has been visualized both by the president of the commission and in the sound and efficient management documents that have been put before us .
when i turn to the council i have to say that its attitude in the process is deplorable .
80 % of the expenditure is spent in the member states .
the fiddles that affect the european taxpayer largely take place in the member states and under their jurisdiction .
the clearance of accounts is in the member states .
the fines are then against the member states .
i could just as easily cite the other member states ; i am only choosing italy because i know it will be close to the president-in-office of the council .
other member states such as spain , greece , ireland and the united kingdom , have all been fined in the clearance of accounts procedures .
yet this council , which is long on rhetoric when it comes to value for money and the fight against fraud , is short on action .
the action of the council has been to send a civil servant to the committee who could not answer a single political question and to absent itself from our debate today .
granted it is absent to be at a trialogue , but they were the people who double-booked the meeting !
it is a contempt of parliament .
we might just as well have had a debate with an empty chair .
that has been the level of the contribution that the council has made to our procedures .
mr president , first of all i should like to associate myself with what mr tomlinson has just said .
however , we can already see growing signs that the court lacks the material resources to achieve the objectives which parliament itself has laid down .
and the requirement under the maastricht treaty to prepare a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts will contribute still more to putting pressure on certain material resources which are already very tight .
however , i think that the majority of this assembly would not approve such an application of the principle of subsidiarity .
but it is clear that more effective machinery for cooperation between the court of auditors and national audit departments must be set up .
all that comes from different constitutional systems which make it very difficult - though not impossible - to establish indispensable machinery for collaboration to ensure that community resources are satisfactorily controlled .
the commitment and political will of the members of this assembly to strengthen the material capacity of the court of auditors to perform its duties must be very clear .
i should like to end by congratulating all the rapporteurs whose capacity and readiness for discussion are shown by the small number of amendments tabled .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on the discharge for 1994 is proving of to be of greater importance than in the past .
in particular , we must ensure that there is greater transparency and publicity , particularly as regards the administration of direct funding , in certain vital sectors such as tourism and , more generally , internal policies .
we shall have , if necessary , to look into the possibility of setting up a committee of inquiry into the protection of the community 's financial interests .
mr president , i would like to start off by commending mr wynn for his discharge report on the general budget .
i believe that the rapporteur has succeeded in putting his finger right on the sensitive points which need to be highlighted .
i agree that a change has taken place recently .
co-operation with the commission is now conducted in a more positive spirit than hitherto .
i believe , however , that it is depressing to note that there are so many repetitions in the discharge reports , year after year .
we must impose a requirement that if the regulations are not observed , aid will be reduced , so that there are also consequences in this area for failure to comply with the applicable rules .
it is imperative that the purpose of the aid which we provide through the phare programme is to pave the way for enlargement with the eastern and central european countries .
however , the very fact of discussing these deficiencies openly and frankly can go some way towards generating confidence .
nothing should be swept under the carpet .
in this respect , all the reports paint a very clear picture and have the support of my group .
as i see it , there are two main areas of difficulty .
we must cut the ground from under the opportunists .
what do i meant by that ?
my colleague mr samland , and of course the council , will have more to say on this point .
if the rules on the administration of the structural funds are not observed , and if this does not incur , for example , the suspension of further payments , then such an approach is actually being encouraged .
it is a fact that 80 % of the eu budget is spent by the member states , and it is precisely there that significant deficiencies are emerging .
however , we shall get nowhere simply by issuing appeals .
as long as the eu budget functions with the present high level of subsidies from the agricultural and structural funds , there must be a range of sanctions mechanisms to prevent irregularities going unpunished .
the commission should therefore take very seriously all the proposals made by the committee on budgetary control for securing and recovering sums wrongly disbursed .
as regards external policy , the important thing is to overcome difficulties in the treaties , in order to achieve a more transparent spending policy and genuine cooperation between the two arms of the budgetary authority .
that applies equally to the european development fund and to the common foreign and security policy .
parliament has repeatedly called for the edf to be integrated into the budget .
the reasons for taking such a step are obvious , and led the court of auditors to comment that it was hard to draw any comparison between what was intended and what was implemented .
i would therefore say to all those who argue that a refusal to grant discharge would be an insult to development policy in general and our commitments under the lom&eacute; convention in particular : it is quite the opposite !
the financial subculture that we are currently sustaining is creating major administrative weaknesses .
we are meant to grant discharge , even though we have no influence or effective political control over how the resources are spent .
that has to change , not least in order to improve the quality of our development policy !
refusing discharge will , therefore , send the right signal to the intergovernmental conference , to tell them that it is time they came up with an institutional solution to this dilemma .
i also expect the conference on the revision of the treaty to produce clarification of the common foreign and security policy and associated budgetary matters .
there is a major procedural loophole , and unfortunately it now also affects discharge , because at the end of the day , parliament cannot discharge the council .
with regard to mrs kjer hansen , it was very clear that where there are corrections to be made , this should not be a political , negotiable matter .
it should be an objective matter based on the actual loss .
i follow mr cornelissen 's report on this point .
he explained that the money was not recovered because no member state had applied to the court .
this really will not do .
we have to get a new and better system that will work because they will find it inexplicable otherwise .
there is room for improvement .
to come to mr wynn 's general discharge , he says that he is recommending a discharge on assurances by the commission .
it is a bit difficult to know how we will vote because the commission has not been here to hear him and to give these assurances .
so what are they worth ?
we will not know , unless it reads the transcript tonight .
the council is here now but it did not hear either .
it is a very unsatisfactory situation .
i will have to explain that to my group at tonight 's meeting .
i am very critical of the member states .
they are dealing here with the european taxpayers ' money .
they do not seem to take it seriously enough .
we should not be giving the fig leaf of respectability that was mentioned by getting involved in a procedure where we really cannot act properly because we do not have proper control .
if i could have that assurance i could advise my group .
if it does not make any financial difference , if it does not destroy their confidence , then i could go along with the refusal to discharge .
but i would quite like to hear about that .
mr president , representative of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin with a comment on procedure .
i should like to point out that we are discussing eight reports in under three hours .
one of these concerns action to be taken following the 1992 discharge , namely mr cornelissen 's report .
on this subject , you will remember the discussions on the discharge in question , which was postponed for more than a year .
the second of these reports concerns action to be taken following the 1993 discharge .
is this reasonable ?
should not more time have been allowed for each of these reports ?
but do you know what this foundation 's budget is ?
i say this for the benefit of those who listen to us here : ecu 810 , 000 or 0.04 % of the edf .
i tabled an amendment which simply specified these amounts .
without being contested , this amendment was rejected .
why ?
in truth it was because the decision on discharge had been made in advance .
the arguments put forward are no more than pretexts .
discharge to the commission was refused because the edf is not integrated into the community budget .
so i should like to ask a few questions .
why was discharge granted at the time of previous edf budgets when similar criticisms had been raised and the legal framework was the same ?
have we taken into account the disastrous consequences , in political terms , of this refusal to grant discharge on the conference of acp countries , in terms of the way they perceive the commitment of the european countries ?
before requesting additional competences for parliament , would it not be better to ensure that there are more deputies able to implement them ?
mr president-inoffice , commissioner , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am very sorry that i am only now able to take part in this debate .
as you know , i do not make a habit of being late , because part of debating is , of course , being able to respond to what one 's colleagues have said .
i am exceptionally sorry about this , and it certainly does not mean that we underestimated the importance of this debate , but it does explain why we could not be here on time .
it has to be said , mrs m&uuml;ller , that there are certain points where one has the feeling that it should have been possible , somewhere between 1991 and 1996 , to achieve some movement .
a look at the tobacco regulation or the regulations in the wine sector , however , forces one to the conclusion that even five years is not long enough to see progress .
let me say something more on these four points , and firstly on tobacco .
we have a report before us from the court of auditors on this issue .
we asked the commission to submit a report on it , a report which was to be based on the court of auditors ' guidelines and submitted by 1 april .
the same applies to the wine sector , which is a virtual disaster .
we insisted that a register should be compiled - properly compiled in every member state .
now a new register is to be set up because the first procedure posed too many problems .
however , we are still paying for the current procedure and , of course , the new procedure is not available yet .
whose fault is it that the reform proposals have not been properly implemented ?
as in the previous case i referred to , the culprit is the council .
furthermore , the council has some 256 decisions pending , whereas here in parliament we have only 52 decisions in the pipeline .
that shows where the bottleneck and the imbalance between the institutions is to be found .
the third point concerns interest for the structural funds .
last but not least , transfers of appropriations by dg xix .
the committee on budgetary control has unanimously approved my draft report on this issue .
i am here to present the council recommendation , adopted on 11 march and transmitted to the house , that the commission be granted discharge for the budget for the 1994 financial year .
i am sure that you share the view of the presidency and the council that the two institutions need to work in harmony , including when it comes to measures concerning the community budget .
firstly : the decisions should reflect the needs of communities ; secondly : the resources should be used economically and efficiently ; and , thirdly , there should be complete transparency in resource management and accounting .
those criteria assume crucial importance at the current time when the member states are having to contend with well-known social and financial problems .
in its recommendation , the council emphasizes that budgetary discipline and respect for the principles of sound management , to which i referred , have to be applied to all measures funded from community resources .
it is vital that there should be a period review of the reasons that led to the adoption of the measures under way in order to guarantee economy and efficiency in resource utilization .
that should always be done independently of the assessments made to prepare budgetary decisions .
the reports of the court of auditors and the monitoring activities on which they are based provide the basic instruments that permit us to monitor the application of those principles .
we have to congratulate the court of auditors for the efficient way in which it performs this task assigned to it by the treaties .
in the field of own resources , the council shares the concerns of the court of auditors about the operation of the community transit scheme in the member states .
in that connection , it is most certainly interested in the european parliament 's suggestion that a temporary committee of inquiry be set up to look into these customs arrangements .
moving on to the structural funds , the council notes the persisting and major problem of an excessive concentration of commitments and payments towards the end of the financial year .
the council considers it necessary to improve cooperation between the competent national authorities and the commission services involved in spending activities .
we need also to make a greater effort to clarify the criteria governing the admissibility of expenditure and the verification of declarations of expenditure .
the council has pointed out that the accounts accurately reflect the revenue and expenditure of the union , even though the information they contain needs to be improved .
that has been at the root of the council 's concern , and it has welcomed the announcement of the programme to improve the commission 's financial management .
that programme must be applied rapidly and in full to reduce errors in payment transactions .
that is what the presidency had to say , on behalf of the council , on the problems relating to the 1994 budget .
mr president , i may have misheard what was said .
the council referred to the european regional development fund , but it did not take a position on the european development fund .
mr wynn warned that the discharge would be suspended .
the house would appreciate a response to what we have advocated , so that then we know where we stand .
we also have to form an opinion on these matters within our group .
the council cannot simply sweep its problems under the carpet now , because the scandal has made them quite apparent .
i should like a response from the council on this question .
does the council wish to speak again or wait until a later occasion ?
i prefer to wait , mr president .
mr president , as spokesperson for the socialist group on development , i deplore the fact that the management of the european development fund is not democratically accountable .
i deplore the fact that we go through this annual pretence , this annual charade , when parliament has no say whatsoever over the funding of the edf .
i deplore the disgrace of the management of the cultural foundation .
it was a scandal which was investigated by the bureau of the joint assembly of the lom&eacute; convention of which i was a member .
we called witnesses and carpeted individuals , including a key member of the european parliament .
i make that specific point to be fair to the commission .
cultural cooperation is central to development and has suffered a big setback because of this scandal .
i trust that the refusal to grant discharge will speed up the move towards the democratic accountability of the edf .
i wish to put on record that this parliament formally deplores the disgusting scandal of the cultural foundation .
i express the view that the commission should be vigilant and meticulous in supporting these views , about which i believe both the commission and parliament are in full agreement .
will the council now please as a matter of urgency exercise its responsibility to ensure that the funds of the edf are properly accountable .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , eight discharge reports have been presented , not quite in the order indicated on the agenda , but we appreciate the reasons for that .
it is impossible to speak on them all in four minutes .
i wish to look at only a few key points , but i should like to extend my sincere thanks to all the rapporteurs .
i shall begin with a word about the authority to grant discharge itself , and about our committee on budgetary control .
for 20 years now , we have had the authority to grant discharge , and we have constantly been developing it .
he performed his task well in so far as he could .
now you , mr president-in-office , have addressed the house , and i think you have also listened carefully to what has been said here .
our comments have been directed mainly at the member states , but it is not the member states to whom we must grant discharge .
i should like to turn now to the issues involved .
this time , the discharge of the commission involves two instruments which have been used for the first time - instruments , as i said , directed specifically at the member states .
the first innovation is our vote on the clearance of accounts for the eaggf , submitted by the commission for 1991 .
clearance of accounts was previously classed as a technical procedure for which the commission was responsible .
parliament had little to do with it .
it is thanks to mr cornelissen , as rapporteur on the 1992 discharge , that the problems from previous years have been raised .
a particular problem which has been brought out into the open is the loss to the community of some ecu 1.6 billion on milk quotas in three member states .
detailed discussions between the committee on budgetary control and the commission have produced reform as regards the clearance of accounts decision , which now completes the discharge already granted for the year in question .
this procedure is being applied for the first time for the year 1991 , with the very good report by mrs kjer hansen .
the rapporteur deserves our thanks for highlighting the difference between the technical and political aspects .
the necessary financial corrections applied by the commission to the member states are absolutely non-negotiable where losses to eu funds are involved .
if this is not the case , then the discharge for the clearance of accounts will have to be suspended until the monies are recovered .
an initial tangible result of parliament 's insistence on protecting taxpayers ' money is that the first tranche of the unpaid milk quotas has been received .
the second innovation , the statement of assurance , or das , by the court of auditors , has far-reaching implications as regards discharge .
the rapporteur , mr wynn , has done this in the motion for a resolution from the committee on budgetary control , and his readable explanatory statement provides us all with an invaluable aid to understanding this complex issue .
i would like to thank him particularly for that .
my group therefore backs the recommendation to grant discharge to the commission in respect of the general budget for 1994 , in spite of the shortcomings that have been identified , and subject to the appropriate conditions .
madam president , it is appropriate that in discussing budgetary matters we make some reference to the key principles governing responsible budgetary control , such as prudence and the allocation of funding to appropriate and deserving projects .
however , it is clear that not all european projects adhere to these principles and i wish to refer to one in particular .
i am speaking about the administration of our own finances within our own structures .
recent visitors to brussels were taken aback by the continuing construction of the european parliament 's new headquarters there , which has been going on since 1990 , and the ornate nature of the building in question .
this latter-day glass tower of babel is utterly unnecessary and a waste of resources which parliament could have more constructively utilized for other aspects of its work .
all these ecu saved are now being heedlessly squandered .
meps , who have a democratic mandate from the electorate , were not consulted on the building of this folly or allowed any opportunity to veto its construction .
instead , the building of this glass palace has continued unimpeded .
it is particularly ironic that we are discussing budgetary and fiscal matters today in this parliament .
if ever there was an example of budgetary irresponsibility , it is the grandiose edifice currently taking shape in brussels .
perception is very important in this european parliament and this is no help to it .
madam president , i have a number of comments on the wynn report on the discharge for the 1994 financial year .
first of all , what he says about agriculture .
i think that in future it will be almost impossible to forecast agricultural expenditure with any accuracy .
so i think it is always better to err on the side of caution , so that we are always able to honour the guarantees we give our farmers .
one aspect over which we do have control is to make the rules as clear as possible , but as many people have already pointed out , they still leave a lot to be desired .
if a political decision is to be taken on how the rules are to be revised , i think it should be a matter for the commission , the council and parliament together .
my second comment concerns the phare programme .
could we not bring officials from the agriculture ministries in the countries of the former eastern bloc over to brussels , and send dg vi people to those countries to explain its policy ?
it is doing practically nothing to implement directives on public contracts or the environment .
the reason for this is clear : if it did so , the structural funds would end up being even more seriously underspent than at present .
i find it hard to believe that the 50 % profit all goes to the contractors .
the situation with the environment is no better .
the main reason for this , as i have said before , is that most of the commissioners regard it as far more important to spend the budget than to respect legislation .
i entirely agree with what mr liikanen said in a letter concerning community customs , that the commission has no choice but to carry on enforcing existing legislation .
that is just as it should be .
but in my experience , it is not what the commission actually does .
madam president , my colleague from my constituency , mr killilea , was at his colourful best when he described the new european parliament as the tower of babel .
i am sure it is designed to attract the maximum attention , but i do not want that sort of allegation circulating in my constituency unanswered .
we did not build a parliament for the members of parliament who are here today .
we built it for the people of europe .
it was built at a cost of about ecu 3 per capita for one year of the people of this european union .
i am proud of that building .
it reflects some of the technology and the grandeur of the age and the competence of the people of europe of this day .
the attack by mr killilea was not worthy of a member of parliament .
if he had attended regularly to the business of this house he would have known that we were consulted .
if he was not prepared to be here at all times then he could trust his colleagues who were here and made the decisions .
i want to thank mr wynn for his report .
i support his refusal of discharge .
i am not looking at it in the area of the european development fund .
i do not agree with the tone of his criticism in relation to agricultural spending .
the expertise and the knowledge that i find in the commission surprises me at times .
it is a most infinitely complicated business to try to forecast what the cost of agriculture will be for any year .
parliament is continuously a little bit harsh insofar as this sort of criticism is concerned .
the last point i want to make is in relation to the fine that was imposed on the irish government .
unfortunately the irish taxpayers have to accept this while they got no benefit out of malpractices which led to it .
i want to underline the fact that it was not at european level but within the irish parliament that the first disclosures and demand for clarification on all these abuses occurred .
this fine was exceptionally harsh in that it was equivalent to ecu 1 , 000 million for the british or the italians .
irish agriculture got no benefit out of it whatever .
madam president , i will refer to the report by our esteemed colleague mr edward kellett-bowman on postponement of the discharge to the management board of the european centre for the development of vocational training in thessaloniki .
frankly , i did not understand why mr kellett-bowman is asking for postponement .
is he doing so because there was a financial scandal in the management up till 1994 ?
if so , he should say so in his report , he should describe it to us , and i believe we would then all go along with him .
however , his report mentions no such thing .
on the contrary , it expresses doubts about the continuation of that centre 's operation - cedefop 's operation - related to its productivity and efficacy .
those who had powerful political protectors were transferred to other services of the european union .
those who were close to pensionable age requested early retirement , which they were granted , and finally , those who did not fit either of these categories resigned .
so of approximately 100 people , less than half are now in thessaloniki .
and i , ladies and gentlemen , would like to ask : is that how europe 's enlargement will take place ?
when the eastern countries accede in due course , will certain spoiled members of staff refuse to transfer to capitals outside the parisberlin-brussels triangle ?
is that the basis for the european parliament 's policies on decentralization and regional development ?
i am very sorry , but unless i get serious answers to the questions i have raised , my recommendation to my group will be to vote against mr kellettbowman 's report .
madam president , i wish to speak with reference to mr blak 's report on the ecsc on the discharge for 1994 .
i would like to draw members ' attention to paragraph 11 in mr blak 's report that is on the uk pit closures .
can we look very briefly at the wording of mr blak 's report ?
it says , very interestingly , it accepts that the ecsc will not be able to recover by legal means the interest rate subsidies paid to financial production enhancing investment .
but if it cannot be returned by legal means , is mr blak , or is the commission , going to send the boys round to 10 downing street to ask for the money back ?
what is at stake here ?
the court of auditors ' report says quite clearly that under article 54 , 15 pits received subsidies .
two of them were closed .
one - lea hall in my constituency - has received an unrecoverable subsidy of almost half-a-million ecu and frickley colliery a subsidy of ecu 294 million , which has not been recovered from the british government .
monies have also been paid to pits which were subsequently privatized - two , again , in my constituency : trentham and silverdale .
i know that when trentham was privatized , much of the equipment paid for by the ecsc was actually bricked-up .
how are you going to get that money back for us and stop it happening again ?
the question of the staffing of uclaf is similarly important .
this means that it must also be given the level of staffing that it requires .
this has demonstrated the importance of checks and the need to extend their scope significantly , so that the member states , too , can be made aware of their own responsibility .
the final issue that i wish to highlight concerns the satellite bodies , the decentralized institutions which are based in individual member states , but work for the union as a whole .
our greek colleague has referred to the centre for the development of vocational training .
as a result of its move to thessaloniki , this centre is experiencing difficulties .
mr kellett-bowman and the committee were right to recommend that we should defer discharge until this body acquires a clear function and provides a quality of service commensurate with the need .
we shall see whether this is to be the case .
if so , the centre will have a purpose .
if not , we must draw the necessary conclusions .
madam president , the debate on discharge for the european budget clearly throws up one important reason for the disenchantment with europe that we see in our countries .
one of the causes of disenchantment is the somewhat lax approach to money - european taxpayers ' money .
i have been following the debate today with interest , because it has focused quite clearly on the question of finding a culprit : was it the member states , or was it the commission ?
i see this as a rather fruitless line of inquiry .
the european parliament is being shuttled here from pillar to post .
i cannot entirely absolve the commission from blame .
through its refusal , parliament will let it be known that we are no longer prepared to cover for goings-on which deserve to be highlighted , rather than concealed .
it is clear that irregularities , such as that involving the cultural foundation , occur in areas where the responsibilities are ill defined .
to put it plainly , it is our wish and our demand that the european development fund should become part of the european budget , so as to remove the grounds for mismanagement in this area .
i hope that the new member states , too , will have some pertinent suggestions .
however , i think that we are also entitled to expect active support from the commission .
i think this is extremely questionable .
indeed , it has to be asked whether the commission takes the whole business seriously enough , and i would simply remind you of how the debate opened .
i was not made sufficiently aware today of the way in which the council and the member states are involved in this whole process .
i also think that in many cases , the commission 's attitude to member states which step out of line , by failing to observe the conditions , is half-hearted .
in any event , i have no hesitation at all in supporting the proposal to defer or even refuse discharge in the case of cedefop , but this situation cannot go on indefinitely .
i already see reason enough to ask whether we should not be thinking in terms of closure .
contrary to the view of one of the previous speakers , mr kellett-bowman made it very clear that there is no assurance at all that this centre is performing its functions efficiently .
in conclusion , i should simply like to make a point which i think has been neglected this year - that just as we have been looking at expenditure , we must also consider revenue .
we referred to the fact that this task is being undertaken in the committee of inquiry .
however , the committee reflects only some of the major concerns in this area which we need to discuss .
madam president , at the outset , i must state that i have particular reservations about mr kellett-bowman 's report on cedefop .
the report refers to minor financial management problems , which lead it to conclude that cedefop 's discharge concerning the financial year 1994 must be postponed .
the proposal to postpone discharge is based on a report by external consultants , which is unclear about the extent to which it refers to the financial year 1994 .
i suspect that other aims and aspirations lie behind this attitude , such as restricting cedefop 's activities and closing it down , as the report indirectly implies .
yet , it was a policy decision that we all ought to respect and support .
the utility of cedefop is enormous at a time when unemployment is one of the european economy 's gravest problems .
madam president , i think the european commission has an obligation to make better use of cedefop 's contribution , as the rapporteur himself also said .
besides , a long-term programme prepared by cedefop has already been prepared , and this must be given serious attention .
finally , i would like to invite the rapporteur , when he visits thessaloniki , to assess the situation objectively .
for the present , i call on the rapporteur to delete paragraph 2 of the motion for a resolution , which casts doubt upon cedefop 's utility .
it must be said that this is only the tip of the iceberg .
i believe that it is the role of this commission and of this council to monitor and control the use of those funds and to take action .
i am afraid it is simply not good enough to say that , for legal reasons , the commission cannot act to recover taxpayers ' money .
it simply will not wash with the public and they will see the hypocrisy of our policies .
therefore , i ask the commission and the council to take action .
two years ago i tabled parliamentary questions on this matter .
as yet we have had no results on that .
madam president , i wish to refer to mr samland 's report , on which i congratulate him .
i welcome in particular his reference to the tacis programme and the greater need for commitment to the monitoring of tacis projects .
there is also a need , as the rapporteur stated , for a better dissemination of the results of the tacis programme .
tacis has poured some &pound; 600 million into the russian federation , for example , in the last five years .
yet does parliament have a clear idea of where the money has been spent or how effective tacis has been ?
the answer must be a resounding no !
increased accountability and transparency must be given top priority , including increased monitoring of programme spending for the newly-independent states of the former soviet union .
but this must not be at the expense of swift and efficient implementation .
i should like to apologise for the delay at the beginning but we were spending time together with members of the committee on budgets and presidency trying to solve the problems of next year 's budgetary procedure .
the debate today and the vote tomorrow bring to a close the review of the financial activities of the community in 1994 .
the process of external control is a key part of the efforts to improve the effectiveness and the value for money of the community budgets .
each step - from the reports of the court of auditors to the thorough deliberations of the european parliament - reinforces the efforts for financial management reform in the commission and across the community .
the committee on budgetary control , based on a report by mr wynn , recommends giving discharge to the commission with regard to the general community budget for 1994 .
discharge is also proposed concerning the european coal and steel community and the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions in dublin , based on the reports of mr blak and mr kellett-bowman , respectively .
the commission welcomes these proposals .
in this context i want to reply to mr blak on the question of bagnoli , italy .
the subsidy was fully paid back by the end of the last year .
the discharge for the cedefop is postponed .
the commission will work with the rapporteur , mr kellett-bowman , to clarify the outstanding issues .
finally , with regard to the european development fund , based on a report by mr wynn , it is proposed to reject the discharge .
i will return to this question in a moment .
the particularity of the 1994 discharge procedure is that it has to evaluate the results of a new instrument introduced by the maastricht treaty , the ' statement of assurance ( das ) ' .
at the same time , the necessity to come to general conclusions on the basis of a small sample poses difficult methodological questions .
there is also the difficulty of explaining the meaning of the results to a broader public .
as has already been said today , the headlines of : ' billion ecu fraud and waste ' - unfounded as they were - show the difficulty of a broader public to comprehend this instrument .
it is therefore particularly valuable that the comprehensive and balanced assessment of the first das by mr wynn will establish a reference for future exercises .
i want to congratulate the commission and mr wynn for their excellent work .
i especially want to refer to the explanatory note because it is conceptually a very difficult issue and it is very clearly explained in the note .
this might even prove to be a useful reference for the commission in the future .
the commission will continue to work with the court of auditors and outside experts to improve the methodology of das .
the main consequences to be drawn from the first das are twofold .
firstly , all efforts will continue to eliminate sources of errors identified in das .
the errors attributed to the commission - mainly formal - have been addressed as part of the first two stages of the sound and efficient management programme ( sem 2000 ) .
the errors attributed to the member states - often substantial - will be addressed in the third stage of the exercise .
this stage has been launched .
the first meeting of the group of personal representatives of the ministers of finance of 7 march 1996 was fruitful .
a work programme was agreed .
it covers topics from the preparation of the budget to financial control .
the first items discussed in some depth included the question of eligibility of structural funds expenditure and the possibility of reinforced sanctions .
these questions are identified by the 1994 discharge report as the key question for the structural funds .
as mr samland said in his report , this is a key issue .
we hope that in the working group we are going to find a solution .
the discussions in the group of personal representatives confirmed expectations that progress on the questions will be difficult .
a number of member states took a view opposite to the approach of the court of auditors and the european parliament .
there is , in fact , a built-in contradiction between , on the one hand , ambitious quality objectives and , on the other hand , the political commitment to ' spend it all ' by 1999 .
the european council of madrid has given a strong impetus to increasing quality of spending and examining the possibility of new sanctions .
but the basic contradiction remains .
the commission will therefore - from now on - provide a report on the follow-up of each serious payment error .
this report will be made available jointly with the annual financial accounts .
furthermore , the claims forecasts ( or pr&eacute;visions de cr&eacute;ances ) will from now on be established by sector .
the amounts will be estimated by the commission services concerned regardless of the source of information which establishes an irregularity .
the recovery will then be pursued according to the sectional procedures in place .
in different sectors we have different procedures .
as far as internal policies are concerned , the 1994 discharge report expresses serious doubts on the transparency of procedures with regard to direct financing and subsidies .
there is little evidence to support this view in the report of the court of auditors .
in fact , it should be noted that both life and research expenditure have their specific , detailed rules assuring transparency with regard to project selection and programme evaluation .
publication in the official journal is mandatory .
tourism activities have been thoroughly evaluated .
the results will be transmitted to parliament in a few weeks ' time .
i highly recommend reading this report as an informative approach to the evaluation methodology in which i strongly believe for the future .
the commission will work with parliament on any useful improvement .
instead of another horizontal report covering all of category 3 , it would however be more effective to focus on individual programmes through ex ante and ex post evaluations for each programme concerned .
let me turn then to the european development fund .
the committee on budgetary control proposes not to discharge the commission .
this proposal is not primarily based on bad management by the commission .
in fact mr wynn 's report recognizes the commission 's attempts to improve edf financial management although it criticizes the financial management of the acp cultural foundation .
instead the main reason is the non-budgetization of the edf .
the commission regrets this proposal .
for its part it will continue its best efforts to improve the administration of the edf .
the management mistakes made with regard to the cultural foundation are recognized but consequences have been drawn from this experience and the foundation has been shut down .
it should also be borne in mind that the amounts involved were quite small .
furthermore , the commission has always shared the criticism of parliament concerning the legal and financial framework of the edf .
the commission will continue to press for budgetization of the edf .
but to refuse discharge until the edf is budgetized , while being understandable and consistent , may mean that until such a time parliament 's voice will not exist with regard to the edf implementation .
finally , as you are certainly aware , there are those in the commission dealing with development policy who fear that the refusal of discharge may make development policy more difficult in future .
let me conclude with two replies to mrs kjer hansen and mr cornelissen , whom i also want to thank for their excellent reports .
mrs kjer hansen talked about the resources in the clearance of accounts .
we have known the needs there , but i want to say that the commission has already taken a decision for the 1997 budget that we will not ask new resources outside the enlargement budget .
so we will do all we can within the redeployment and the enlargement budgets .
mr cornelissen had a number of questions here .
first of all , concerning the recovery of the funds for exceeding the milk quotas , we are recovering the funds in four years which means in four equal tranches .
in 1995 we have already received ecu 450m ; ecu 450m has been decided for this year and budgetized and two other tranches will be recovered in 1997 and 1998 .
as far as tobacco fraud is concerned , investigations and legal proceedings continue .
the commission will keep parliament informed of any new developments .
as to the buy-back scheme of milk quotas , the legal base has in the meantime been adopted and the commission considers this matter closed .
on the spanish milk quota in 1989 the commission does not have a legal base to change the decision .
this is also the position of the court of justice .
finally , on the dutch calves i will transmit that question to commissioner fischler .
my expertise is not sufficient for that .
there was also a question on the ecsc loans to british coal .
we discussed this matter also a year ago .
i am sorry to say this but , according to the opinion of the legal service , there is no legal base for the commission to recover these subsidies on the grounds that british coal was subsequently closed .
finally , i want to extend thanks to mrs theato , the chairman of the committee on budgetary control for these exceptionally thorough and productive discharge procedures for 1994 .
mr president-in-office of the council , would you like to speak ?
madam president , a very brief comment concerning the european development fund .
i would point out that the fund is financed via direct contributions from the member states and not with appropriations from the community budget .
that being so , discharge of the fund budget was not mentioned in today 's speech by the presidency .
madam president , we must correct that statement if it is going to be in the record .
what came through in english was that parliament plays no part in discharge of the edf .
that is the whole point .
we play a part in that and in nothing else .
madam president , there is a very serious conflict here between the commission and council that we need to clarify .
the commission has alleged that unless we grant the discharge concerning the european development funds , it may make their work more difficult .
this was followed by a statement from the council informing us that we do not have any responsibility whatsoever to discharge the edf .
could they get their act together and tell us what the situation is ?
madam president , i am grateful to the council for the information it has just given us , but i would appreciate it if the accuracy of that information could be checked again .
as far as i am aware , it is not accurate .
there is definitely a recommendation from the council as regards the development fund .
i would therefore ask for this point to be checked again .
madam president , on this point i fully support what mrs theato has just said .
i should simply like to make the point , at the end of this debate , that there has been frequent mention of the respective presence of the institutions during the procedure .
commissioner liikanen was present to reply to the rapporteurs but four of the eight rapporteurs were absent .
we will take note of this .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 12 noon on wednesday .
question time ( commission )
the next item is question time to the commission ( b4-0431 / 96 ) .
the removal of controls on goods and baggage at internal frontiers does not flow from the schengen agreement .
further reductions in and the final abolition of such checks will depend on the gradual increase of travellers ' exemptions and on future developments in the rules applicable to travellers crossing borders ' .
it is , in particular , the community instruments , adopted to complete the internal market , that guarantee the removal of controls on goods and baggage at internal frontiers .
i posed this question because the opponents of cooperation under schengen always maintain that accession to schengen will make it more difficult to catch criminal gangs .
as the honourable member is aware , the commission is taking part in the meetings of the schengen executive committee as an observer .
the application of the schengen agreement has therefore stimulated cooperation in the field of activities of prevention and control applied by the competent authorities of the various member states .
i therefore believe that the response - of particular interest to those countries which are considering acceding to schengen in the future - may be encouraging .
mr president , i should like to take up the issue raised by mr haarder 's question .
at present the situation is that these controls are conducted on the basis of spot checks without the national customs authorities in denmark and sweden having to have any suspicions of criminal behaviour .
does the commissioner consider that such spot checks , not based on any suspicion of criminal behaviour , are compatible with the schengen agreement ?
it is sufficient that are not carried out automatically because the frontier is being crossed .
controls are in any case possible far from frontier zones and , on occasion , even at the frontier , but they have to be based on the assumption that the frontier has been crossed .
mr president , this surprises me a little as we have been told that it will no longer be allowed for sweden to carry out spot checks of the kind carried out before we acceded to the european union .
this question is therefore extremely important .
some change is surely bound to happen in connection with the schengen agreement ?
however , given that the crossing of internal frontiers can no longer form the basis for carrying out checks , the exercise of that power must form part of a system of controls covering the territory as a whole .
any power to carry out checks that is able to exercised solely where or because an internal frontier has been crossed would therefore be incompatible with article 7a .
as the author is not present , question no 19 lapses .
i apologize to commissioner flynn and to mr mcmahon who rushed to the chamber for this question .
question no 20 by brian crowley ( h-0240 / 96 )
subject : duty-free shopping
duty-free shopping at airports , on airlines and on car ferries is a voluntary activity on the part of travellers , the profits from which contribute significantly towards the viability of many airports , air and ferry routes .
in addition , the products sold in duty-free outlets throughout the world are dominated by brand names from european union companies whose competitiveness is assisted by duty-free sales during international travel within the european union .
that is the thirteenth recital of directive 91 / 680 .
the commission wishes to make it quite clear that in considering the issue of duty-free sales it has to be borne in mind that refraining from collecting taxes in specific sectors is in fact tantamount to granting aid .
it will therefore be difficult for the commission to consider extending the facilities for duty-free shops , as these are arrangements incompatible with the principles of the internal market .
i thank the commissioner for his response .
however , he is somewhat misguided in what he has said .
indeed he is throwing a very unusual veil of secrecy over what is going on .
he said that the duty-free mechanism is contrary to the internal market .
yet one of the major points of any internal market should be the harmonization of vat and excise duty ratings .
that is not happening .
there is no sign of it happening in the near future .
i will try to be brief although the matter is not particularly simple .
duty and tax-free sales to intra-community travellers at airports , on aircraft or on ferries have been authorized by the council until 30 june 1999 .
it should therefore no longer suffer distortions of competition from tax-free sales after the 30 june 1999 deadline , which is the end of the period of adaptation .
so the relevant event which logically produces the necessity for an end to the dutyfree system is not the future definitive vat regime but is something which has already been substantially in place since 1 january 1993 .
i should like to thank the commissioner for the observations he has made .
my own view is that it is a complex matter , as he has said .
it is probably too complex to deal with in this manner .
the commissioner has suggested that duty-free shopping , were it to continue beyond the deadline set by the council , would offend the principles of the internal market ; but it does not necessarily offend against the treaty .
the treaty provides in article 99 for harmonization necessary to ensure the establishment and functioning of the market .
i do not know that the case has yet been well established that the scale of alleged distortion is in some way a significant problem or impediment to the functioning of the internal market .
i should like to ask the commissioner one question .
on 20 november 1990 in a debate on the vat system in relation to the fuchs report your predecessor promised the house a full commission study on the implications of abolishing duty-free sales prior to the date in question .
this question gives me the opportunity to refer to the report .
that is the way it is in many places in europe .
a different transport pattern is produced when duty free sales are done away with in this manner .
finally , i have a question which does not need to be answered , because i realise that it is complex .
we might well ask what duty free sales actually mean : do they distort competition when all the member states take part ?
strictly speaking , they do not .
the last thing which i should perhaps mention is , that as this report is delayed in the commission , it indicates that the actual complexity of the matter just cannot be described in a report .
there are transport , social and regional conditions to be considered .
i hope , however , that we will be able to find a solution together .
the point about transparency is a relevant one .
it is true that the present duty-free system contributes to the financial resources of airports , ferries and so on .
that is what i have said from the beginning in saying that the present duty-free system contains an element of aid .
question no 21 by wayne david ( h-0229 / 96 )
subject : vat claims
what are the procedures involved in claiming back vat on goods and services purchased across the european continent by long-distance lorry drivers ?
the applicant has the right to use the pre-stamped form in any of the official languages of the european union , whereas the form itself must be completed in the language of the country making the refund .
although the commission is aware of the practical problems that these procedures may create for operators , it is not , unfortunately , possible to remedy them in the context of the current vat arrangements .
problems of that nature will , however , come to an end when we move on to the definitive vat regime , based on the principle of taxation in the country of origin .
in fact , the place of taxation will at the same time determine the place at which the tax is deducted .
the commission has indeed considered whether , under the present regime , there is any way of eliminating the inconvenience which i acknowledged is there .
i am afraid we have not been able so far to identify any such possibility .
international removal companies are experiencing very similar problems with vat to those of lorry drivers .
can you confirm which country should levy vat on removals - the country being moved out of or the country being moved into - and can some clear guidance be given to the companies concerned ?
question no 22 by per gahrton ( h-0256 / 96 )
subject : europol
commissioner gradin previously stressed that europol was to take the form of cooperation between police authorities , not between police forces . she rejected the notion of an ' eu fbi ' .
cooperation already takes place among police authorities in interpol .
will the commissioner specify what she personally believes europol can and should do that interpol or its european division is not already dealing with or could deal with ?
under the treaty on european union police cooperation is an issue of common interest .
this is perfectly obvious from both title vi of the treaty and the declaration on police cooperation .
some of this cooperation will be achieved through the development of a union-wide system for information exchange within a european police office , known as europol .
the aim of europol is to improve the opportunities for the competent authorities in the member states to fight serious forms of international organised crime within the european union .
in accordance with the convention there will be close cooperation with interpol .
the council will establish provisions formalising this cooperation and ensure that the various functions complement one another .
thank you for that answer but i do not believe it was a proper answer to my question as to what europol will do that interpol is not already doing .
swedish police chiefs have also expressed public criticism , including the former national head of police , who is also a former president of interpol , who asked more or less the same question .
i would therefore repeat the question : what is europol expected to do in practical terms which interpol does not already do or could do ?
if no answer is forthcoming to this question it is clearly an organisation set up to compete with interpol , in which case one might well ask whether it is necessary at all .
i do not see europol as an institution which will dissipate energies - on the contrary .
europol is needed so that information can be analysed within the european union to enable us better to investigate the crime which occurs .
i do not agree with mr gahrton that the former swedish national head of police is particularly concerned that there may be some overlap between interpol and europol .
in fact , i recently visited lyon with bj&ouml;rn eriksson , where we talked about how europol and interpol should cooperate and how this relationship might be formalised .
this cannot be done before the europol convention is ratified by the fifteen member states , however .
the question raised by the honourable member is a very important one , namely how complaints can be made about europol operations .
bearing in mind how important it is that the court should be involved and act as a complement to the commission , this is particularly significant .
this is why i , and many others , hope that the uk will at last be able to accept the court 's playing a role in the europol convention .
question no 23 by eva kjer hansen ( h-0274 / 96 )
subject : fraud against community resources
what instruments does the commission believe would give the community the practical means required to impose such sanctions and does the commission have the political power to introduce them ?
the commission uses all appropriate means in its fight against fraud which damages the community 's economic interests .
the most recent programme of work to combat fraud indicates clearly where the priorities lie .
there are four main points .
the first concerns an increased presence in the field .
the second is to strengthen cooperation between the commission and the member states , inter alia by establishing cooperation agreements and holding seminars and courses on the application of statutory provisions , including criminal law provisions .
the third main point concerns improving community legislation .
the fourth point deals with the need for greater harmonisation of the member states ' national legislation .
the commission has looked at the issue of sanctions as part of both point 3 and point 4 .
in this context it is important to distinguish between administrative sanctions and penalties under the criminal law .
i should first like to discuss administrative sanctions .
in december 1995 council regulation 2988 / 95 was adopted .
it was based on article 235 of the treaty of rome and article 203 of the euratom treaty .
the regulation contains general rules governing the administrative sanctions which should be applied in the event of irregularities .
all areas of community expenditure are covered , as are own resources .
as you know , sanctions have already been introduced in certain areas , such as agriculture .
the member states have submitted reports on national measures to combat the waste and mismanagement of community resources .
this is also what the council of ministers asked for .
i will now turn to criminal sanctions .
the convention on the protection of the community 's financial interests was signed in july 1995 .
it thus awaits ratification by the parliaments of all fifteen member states and i truly hope that this will be achieved as soon as possible .
the convention lays down that fraud is a criminal offence .
it covers both community resources obtained on false grounds and the withholding of own resources .
a number of additional protocols to the convention are planned , one of which concerns the issue of corruption .
the question of sanctions is also dealt with .
another protocol will deal with the responsibilities of legal persons under the criminal law , such as increased cooperation on legal issues .
within the framework of the current intergovernmental conference the commission has also proposed that the battle against fraud should be incorporated in the first pillar .
i would like to express my thanks for the reply and for the summing up of the contents of the work programme and the provisions already adopted .
however , i would like to ask the commissioner to confirm that it is an untenable position for us not to have common sanctions in all areas .
if there are no such provisions , then there will always be a difference , and that means that there will be those who can get off lightly by circumventing the common rules .
i would therefore ask the commissioner to confirm that what we are trying to achieve is a common system of sanctions in all areas .
may i also ask a question regarding the system of sanctions in relation to the member states ?
the situation is that where the member states ' do not implement rules laid down in law , the commission is able to impose sanctions on them in the form of fines .
we have not yet seen a single example of this option being used .
will the commissioner also make use of sanctions against member states in future ?
of course we shall do our best to exercise control in all areas .
however , the honourable member knows as well as i do that it is in fact an enormous step forward that we have obtained the convention to protect our common resources .
we can only go on with additional protocols and so on , in order to arrive at common forms of cooperation , once the convention has been ratified by all the parliaments .
a brief follow-up question : 70-80 % of eu resources are used within the individual member states .
i very recently saw in my own country , sweden , that it had been suggested there that a special national body should be set up to deal with fraud involving eu funds .
i consider this to be a good initiative because it would also make it easier to press on in the individual member states without perhaps having to resort to common , possibly even supranational , sanctions .
my question is as follows . will commissioner gradin do her best to ensure that similar national bodies are established in other member states in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ?
it is correct that 80 % of eu resources are disbursed to member states .
i have also seen that sweden is thinking of appointing a delegation to check that resources are being used in the correct manner .
we are conducting a dialogue with all fifteen member states concerning which system would suit each individual country and that system is then laid down in an agreement .
as things stand we have six agreements and are continuing efforts to find solutions .
in this connection it is those countries with a federal system which present the stumbling block .
this is an extremely serious problem .
as the author is not present , question no 24 lapses .
question no 25 by maj theorin ( h-0254 / 96 )
subject : extension of the common foreign and security policy to common defence
in its opinion on the holding of an intergovernmental conference ( com ( 96 ) 90 final ) the commission believed ' that a proper common foreign and security policy has to extend to common defence .
the commission therefore calls on the conference to allow the union to review the role of the western european union with a view to incorporating it into the union according to a settled timetable ' .
what does the commission consider to be the implications under international law of thus extending the common foreign and security policy for those member states of the union which are neutral and militarily non-aligned ?
will they have to leave the eu ?
if in individual cases member states are to be allowed to play no part in military missions , will they still be obliged to make a financial contribution to them ?
i therefore find it rather difficult for the commission itself to give further information on this opinion outside the igc .
the commission opinion in question must certainly not be interpreted as implying that any member states will have to leave the union .
all the individual aspects of the member states ' obligations will , of course , be dealt with in detail at the igc .
it is also a fact that the weu comprises member states , 27 of them , the status of which varies as regards their role in the weu .
this naturally gives rise to considerable ambiguity and uncertainty as regards the obligations the countries have vis-&agrave;-vis one another .
would new eu member states perhaps not also have to be covered by the weu mutual security guarantees , and what consequences would that have for the eu 's relations with russia ?
these are all relevant and important questions in the debate on security cooperation in the european union and its implications for defence .
but let me give the honourable member one example of how we can overcome the difficulties that she has identified .
you know that the igc is also to have detailed discussions on the decisionmaking process in matters of foreign and security policy .
a very important question , for example , is whether or not we should abandon the right of veto which currently applies .
let me give you a hypothetical example , which is certain to be discussed in the negotiations at the igc .
this is just a hypothetical example , in the sense that nothing has been decided yet .
i cannot say any more at the moment without pre-empting the outcome of negotiations at the igc .
mr president , i should like to begin by abusing the privilege of the microphone to congratulate the commissioner on the success of the donors ' conference on saturday .
i know he put a lot of personal work into it .
i have two questions .
firstly , it has been suggested that the way around this particular problem would be to suspend article 5 of the weu treaty and therefore perhaps make it easier to integrate neutral states into a future defence union .
what is the commissioner 's view on whether that is a feasible possibility - to suspend article 5 ?
secondly , the commissioner quoted article j.4 , the wording of which is engraved on my heart .
it talks about the eventual framing of a common defence policy which may , in time , lead to a common defence .
therefore it is a long-term objective .
i should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to mr titley .
i saw him at the conference for yugoslavia , and we are all grateful for the fact that the international community has in any event accepted its responsibility to help fund the reconstruction and rehabilitation of bosnia .
so i really cannot say whether this would be an answer to the problem .
i also wonder whether it would be easy to reach agreement on releasing countries from their obligation to provide mutual assistance in this way .
we are currently in the middle of discussions on what we are going to do as regards the union 's defence policy , a subject which i hope will be given serious consideration at the intergovernmental conference .
is this policy going to come under the western european union ? is the western european union going to be incorporated into the european union ?
this is what the commission has recommended in its opinion , and the question now is what the relationship will be between the european union 's defence capacity and nato 's defence capacity .
i hope that this is a subject we shall be able to return to on other occasions at question time .
i should like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
i should also like to talk about the commission 's views on the intergovernmental conference .
let us imagine that it will be as the commission wishes , that foreign policy will be decided by qualified majority voting and that the weu will be integrated in the european union .
let us then imagine a situation in which the union is drawn into an armed conflict and the non-aligned countries choose not to send troops as you described .
do you consider that neutrality in the strictest sense is possible for a nonaligned country which is a member of the european union ?
one final comment on the issue of majority voting versus the veto .
question no 26 by birgitta ahlqvist ( h-0259 / 96 ) , which has been taken over by mrs theorin
subject : eu and belarus
the development of democracy in belarus must be closely monitored .
the constitution confers considerable powers on the president at the same time as the parliament has a great many vacant seats because of the election laws .
allegations of election rigging have been made .
the european parliament has protested ( 12.10.1995 ) against the authorities ' conduct during a strike in minsk in august 1995 .
the eu has now concluded an interim agreement with a view to a partnership agreement with belarus .
it has been announced that belarus and russia will form a union on 2 april .
what form this union will take has not yet been explained but the opposition in belarus have protested strongly against the proposal .
has the commission investigated whether genuine freedom of the press and association exist in belarus ?
is the commission listening to the criticism by the opposition in belarus of the country 's curtailment of democratic freedoms and rights ?
we believe that belarus took a major step forward in 1995 when , despite its rather rigid electoral laws , it finally managed to elect a new parliament .
the people of belarus have shown that they want a democratically elected parliament , and president lukaschenko finally accepted the result and offered the parliament his personal cooperation and that of his government .
the main criticism once again concerned limitations on the freedom of the press during the election campaign .
we also know that the ratification of the partnership agreement is now before parliament .
this is a broader agreement than the interim agreement recently signed by the council and the commission , and the house will certainly be reaching its own conclusions on it .
once again , it is extremely difficult to predict at the moment how things are likely to develop on a political level .
i would therefore hope that the signature by the council and the commission did not take the house by surprise .
commissioner , i am interested in a number of points in relation to what you have said .
firstly , what practical effect has the interim agreement had on positive , democratic development ?
how do you view the fact that decree no 336 , which maintains the ban on trade unions , has not yet been repealed ?
and finally , how do you view the fact that the legal text signed by lukaschenko has not yet been published , despite the fact that the future of relations with russia is the key constitutional issue ?
we actually discussed each of the questions raised by mrs schroedter with the prime minister of belarus when he visited brussels , though i have to say that the answers we received were far from satisfactory .
but the question was whether these extremely serious inadequacies which affect every aspect of its democracy were sufficient grounds for postponing the signing of the agreement yet again .
as i said earlier , this was one of the main reasons why i felt our decision was the right one .
question no 31 by friedrich k&ouml;nig ( h-0068 / 96 )
subject : more rapid completion of the brenner railway line
the commission attaches the utmost priority to the brenner rail project .
it has organized a number of workshops and other meetings with representatives of the governments and railways involved in the brenner axis .
in addition , the commission follows the work of the trilateral brenner commission .
in november 1994 a memorandum on the further development of the munich-verona railway axis was signed by the then transport commissioner , mr oreja , together with the transport ministers of germany , italy and austria .
this memorandum follows a route agreement , including the brenner base tunnel , reached in june 1994 and it specifies actions to improve the financial and economic viability of the project .
the community has committed itself to support the completion of the trans-alpine crossing on the basis of the guidelines for the development of the trans-european transport network and of the available financial instruments .
in this context , the commission has launched a study on the development of alpine traffic which will constitute an important basis for further in-depth economic and financial studies on the brenner project .
it also supports the efforts to create a public / private partnership for the project implementation .
by the end of 1996 the trilateral brenner commission together with the relevant commission service will submit a report which is intended to constitute a basis for a political decision on project implementation .
since 1985 the community has granted financial assistance of ecu 85m from the transport infrastructure programme and the tens transport budget line for the co-financing of feasibility studies and the upgrading of the existing veronabrennero italian line .
the european investment bank has meanwhile committed a loan of ecu 362m for improvements of the existing verona-brennero line which constitutes a preliminary phase of the whole project .
i am glad to hear you confirm that the commission attaches special importance to this project .
road capacity is limited and the environment is under enormous pressure , so rail transport is the only possible option .
my question , commissioner , is as follows . the council has so far refused to declare its support for the 14 priority projects .
what is the commission 's stance regarding parliament 's demand that the 14 priorities should be adhered to ?
i am grateful to the honourable gentleman for his further question .
we are well aware in the commission of the pressures that come both from the geographical features and the potential action of neighbouring countries .
the brenner project will continue to receive very substantial support .
commissioner , my question concerns the fact that mr santer has submitted a plan and put forward ideas for making additional resources available to implement the trans-european networks .
we now know that the brenner base tunnel project , in particular , will demand substantial resources : it is calculated that the munich-verona project as a whole will cost around &ouml;s 160 billion , an incredible sum !
and austria would be required to provide 40 % of that .
my question to you is this : do you think that this very important , high-priority brenner project will be entitled to some of the additional resources that mr santer now wishes to make available for the transeuropean networks ?
i should like to take his mind back to the essen summit .
that call - made , as i said , first at essen - was repeated in madrid only last december .
despite repeated , detailed propositions made to ecofin , ecofin has so far proved to be deaf to those appeals .
so far nothing practical has developed .
what we have done is to take account very directly of the applications made for transport ten funding support from the member states , which are now running at six times the resources available to us .
we know that there are budget constraints and consequently we have also made it clear that we would settle for a top-up that is smaller than the ecu 1.7 billion .
there still has not , so far , been a practical and positive response from ecofin .
we will therefore reconfirm that .
question no 32 by florus wijsenbeek ( h-0082 / 96 )
subject : checks on driving and rest periods : discrimination against foreign lorry drivers in belgium
is the commission aware that there is discrimination against foreign lorries when checks on driving and rest periods are carried out ?
figures show that 72 % of checks in belgium are carried out on foreign vehicles , while in neighbouring countries the figure varies between 15 % and 20 % .
what action does the commission intend taking to induce belgium to reduce these checks on foreign vehicles to normal proportions ?
the commission recently adopted a report on the application of social legislation in road transport in 1991 / 92 .
the report shows that in belgium , 65 % of those drivers subjected to checks on driving and rest hours were nationals of other member states whereas in the netherlands , for example , this figure is 20 % .
the commission has no evidence , however , that belgium does not carry out its controls in an objective way .
information on control operations undertaken in cooperation with bordering member states does not indicate any discrimination either .
the geographical situation of member states and the importance of national road transport companies can , of course , explain certain variations in the numbers of nationals and non-nationals that are controlled .
a small member state with high levels of transit traffic but few national carriers will proportionately check more foreign drivers than would a large , peripheral country with a sizeable national fleet of vehicles subject to community social regulations .
the returns from luxembourg , for instance , show a situation that is comparable with that of belgium .
the commissioner 's view would be correct if - and he lives in belgium himself - 65 % of all lorries on the belgian roads were foreign lorries .
this definitely is not the case , as the commissioner will well know .
therefore , there is still reason to believe that there is discriminatory treatment of foreigners .
i urge the commissioner to do something to ensure that directive 88 / 599 is correctly applied .
this is the first and foremost task of the commission - to see to it that community legislation is correctly applied by all member states .
luxembourg , of course , is a different case because if you drive for five minutes , you are already abroad .
we heed what the honourable member says .
question no 33 by hans lindqvist ( h-0150 / 96 )
subject : the bridge across the &oslash;resund
construction of the bridge across the &oslash;resund , between malm&ouml; and copenhagen , has just begun .
even at this initial stage , the environmental and financial calculations have proved to be incorrect .
the project now looks like overshooting its budget by hundreds of millions of danish kroner .
as regards the environment , it also appears that the limit values set for silt discharges etc. are going to be exceeded .
is the project being part-financed by the eu ?
if so , how much money is involved ?
is the eu planning to provide any further financial or other aid towards the construction of the bridge ?
over the period 1992-1994 danish access routes of the &oslash;resund fixed link received community financial support under the transport infrastructure programme , totalling ecu 21 m in the form of direct grants to the danish authorities .
in 1995 community financial support was awarded under the new regulation for granting community assistance for work on trans-european transport networks .
the co-finance studies for the &oslash;resund fixed link in 1995 included design studies , environmental studies , environmental-impact assessment activities and monitoring , as well as traffic forecast studies .
the co-finance studies for the danish access routes in 1995 included technical design studies , as well as environmental studies and monitoring .
further financial support is envisaged for the period 1996-1999 since the &oslash;resund fixed link is a key element in the development of the trans-european transport network .
indeed , it is a transeuropean network transport priority project .
the 1996 ten transport request for support for the &oslash;resund fixed link is in the form of interest-rate subsidies .
the commission is not aware of any substantial increase in the project 's budget .
mr president , i would thank the commissioner for his answer .
i should like to know whether the commission or the eu has imposed any environmental requirements in granting the funds for the bridge .
according to reports the dredging has produced more sludge than anticipated .
there is much to suggest that there will an incredible increase in traffic and the question is whether the construction of the bridge is really reconcilable with good environmental policy .
there is also much to suggest that the bridge will be more expensive than was expected .
it is possible that there might also be the financing of access routes such as the city tunnel in malm&ouml; and others .
will the eu then grant still more resources to this project ?
i should thus like to ask whether the eu commission has taken note of the judgement made by the credit institution standard & poors that the project as such will not be successful without state guarantees .
there is thus a risk that the eu commission is supporting a project which neither meets environmental requirements nor can be successful on the market .
is this the right way to use resources ?
my answer to that last point of the question is absolutely , definitely yes !
naturally , we are interested in establishing whether that is the case .
there has been absolutely no evidence of any description that would support this testimony .
in 1991 and 1992 the commission examined denmark 's compliance with these directives in relation to the project and was satisfied that no breach had occurred .
moreover , as far as the swedish part of the project is concerned , an application was made by the construction consortium under the swedish natural resources act .
that application was accompanied by an environmental-impact study .
the study , together with a number of sub-reports , was intended to form the basis of the swedish environmental examination of the project .
it is also understood that a danish environmental , non-governmental organization - the danish branch of greenpeace - was recognized in july 1994 as having legal standing to challenge the project on the basis of a deficient environmental-impact assessment .
however , according to a subsequent court ruling , work can continue on the project pending a final ruling .
you will not be surprised to hear that i am sympathetic to the idea of consideration of the development of a new community lending instrument .
president santer has revisited the idea of the so-called eurobonds .
assessments and investigations are taking place now to see whether a further and stronger case can be developed than was originally put for the establishment of a new form of community lending .
question no 34 by konstantinos hatzidakis ( h-0234 / 96 )
subject : development of the egnatia highway by the construction of vertical road axes
the phare programme already co-finances the continuation of some of these axes beyond the european union border to durres and to sofia .
moreover , it is expected that after the settlement of relations with fyrom decisions will be taken for the construction of the continuation of the florina / niki axes to fyrom .
the commission will of course continue its efforts to utilize all possibilities for further co-financing of these links within existing community mechanisms and instruments .
i thank the commissioner for his answer to me .
this constitutes a problem .
i am certain there is not a single project in the whole european union about which i would not say it is possible to make faster progress .
i prefer not to be optimistic .
i simply like to be realistic and it is realistic to say that over a recognisable period of time the strenuous efforts being made by all parties will result in a satisfactory outcome .
that concludes question time .
questions not taken for lack of time will be answered in writing .
( the sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
fisheries agreement with morocco
this agreement has been the main subject of debate in the committee on fisheries in the past few months .
we hope that that situation will not be an exception and will represent a change in the doctrine hitherto followed by the council and the commission as regards the legal bases relating to international fisheries agreements .
however , it must be admitted that at least we were consulted before the date fixed for the first payment of financial compensation under this agreement fell due .
possibly this is not the best agreement , the one which would have suited us best . but possibly , madam commissioner , it is the best agreement possible .
and so the committee on fisheries , after a debate in depth , has agreed to give its assent to the terms negotiated by the commission . we trust the house will approve it .
on the other hand , however , this agreement has shown the growing difficulty in concluding international agreements of this scope .
and that , added to the fact that third countries are gradually developing their fleets and their preserving and processing industry shows up the community fleet 's state of over-capacity .
the committee on fisheries thinks that up to the present this problem has not been seriously faced .
it is clear , madam commissioner , that the next multiannual guidance programmes will be very hard to negotiate , but it will have to be done seriously and strictly and not in a spirit of political opportunism .
madam commissioner , in congratulating you today and in asking the house to approve this fisheries agreement , we cannot overlook the fact that we must make a very serious effort to adapt our fleet to the fishing opportunities .
mr president , madam commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it will shortly be a year since the fisheries dispute erupted between the european union and morocco .
i can point to many events which have taken place since then and which we mentioned at the time in this assembly .
but underlying all that , as was also emphasized at the recent plenary sitting on 27 march in brussels , the urgent need to revise and strengthen the european union 's policy with regard to international fishing agreements .
i also view favourably the fact that for the first time , although belatedly , it has been submitted for the assent of parliament as we had requested .
but basically , i stress , in view of the experience of what has happened and for institutional and sectoral reasons , a new approach to international agreements is required .
politically the european union 's fisheries and external and commercial policy must be linked .
institutionally this parliament must be definitively associated , strictly and as of right , with the negotiation , approval and control of these agreements .
for all those reasons we appreciate the commission 's initiative in holding a seminar in may with this parliament 's members who are on the committee on fisheries , to debate the future european policy on fisheries agreements .
we hope that the quimper meeting will outline the foundations of a new policy and shed light , the light which the sector is asking us for at this time .
mr president , i wish to say that the liberal and democratic reformist group strongly supports and welcomes this agreement and hopes that parliament will allow it to go ahead through the assent procedure .
we welcome the fact that parliament has full power with the council over this agreement via that procedure .
in this agreement there are a number of aspects which greatly improve on other international agreements which parliament has looked at .
i hope there will be sufficient control and that money will be ploughed back into investment in terms of research locally and other areas .
mr president , with regard to the fisheries agreement between the european union and the kingdom of morocco , we ought not to lose sight of overall relations between the two countries and the way they have been developing .
in every international agreement there must be a symmetry which respects and , to the highest degree possible , satisfies the needs of the contracting parties .
in the negotiations morocco exerted pressure on the fishing sector condemning the community fleet to idleness with the object of obtaining concessions in the agricultural sector .
the arguments put forward , ostensibly conservationist , very frequently turned out to be unjustified .
the weakness of the european union 's position cannot be attributed , in our opinion , to the committee on fisheries or to mrs bonino , but is due to the attitude of certain states within the council .
personally i understand mrs bonino 's difficulties during the whole period of negotiations and congratulate her on her performance .
the agreement is not satisfactory for us because it creates a precedent for renegotiation of the agreement .
the european parliament has been consulted , and that is something , but we were also consulted too late .
i should like to associate myself with what some fellow-members have said with regard to the complex problems of agreements with third countries .
let us hope that we all reach a greater appreciation of the difficulties and realize what we have to work for in the seminar at quimper .
mr president , as i pointed out earlier in relation to this agreement , the eu needs to learn lessons from the problems that it has posed .
for example , there is the huge dependence of the eu vessels on access to waters of other countries .
as well as that , in some of these countries there is a desire to reduce eu access to their fish stocks because they are over-exploited and need time to recover .
we also need to change our approach to these agreements .
we should not use them as dumping grounds for the over-capacity of the eu fleet .
we are basically just exporting our own problem with all its negative consequences for these other countries .
we have to place fishing agreements in the wider context of responsible management of regional fisheries , giving greater emphasis to the conservation of fish stocks and the needs of the local communities .
having said that , there are some positive aspects to this agreement .
i welcome the provision made in the agreement for funding the development of the moroccan fisheries sector as well as for improved research on fisheries in the region and for better training of fishermen .
i also welcome the acceptance of the principle that the size of the eu fleet allowed access to moroccan waters should be related to the number of fish actually available to be caught .
as well as that , we really have to realize in the eu that we do not have the right to set up free-for-all fishing in moroccan waters or in the waters of any other country .
however , the council 's decision to apply the agreement provisionally restricts the part played by parliament and partly neutralizes this more democratic trend .
mr president , the regulation now before us on an agreement with morocco concerns more than the fishing industry .
european horticulture is also affected by this agreement , albeit indirectly .
without the trade concessions in the sphere of importation of moroccan vegetables , fruit and flowers the agreement would never have come about .
european horticulture has thus unfairly become the victim of the solution to the fisheries dispute between the union and morocco .
to alleviate the pain the union undertook at the general affairs council of 10 november 1995 to make proposals for a fund to promote ornamental plant products .
so far , six months later , the commission has not yet followed up that commitment .
that is unacceptable !
i expect specific proposals from the commission at the earliest possible date .
this is a sector which is in difficulties , partly owing to increasing imports from third countries as a consequence of the tariff concessions granted in recent years .
products from third countries are therefore being imported almost entirely without duties .
it is high time that the european union did something about it .
is the commissioner ready to give an undertaking ?
if so , then i can vote for the regulation .
in the fisheries sector proper , negotiations with morocco in the framework of the european union have so far been favourable for portugal .
portugal now has three times more fishery permits in morocco than it had in 1995 and its fishery rights are now maintained by a formal legal basis and not merely by a framework of individual licences .
that is why we have fought coherently and continuously for this agreement .
any future agreements will have to call for a smaller fleet to be licensed and will also introduce mixed enterprises , the sustained management of fishery resources .
no responsible person can sit in the shade of a banana tree because fishermen are not and never have been dependent on subsidies - they just want to work .
thirdly , we must have a new fisheries policy .
a new common fisheries policy must be a sustainable and responsible one in which international agreements cannot simply involve exporting structural readjustments of the community fleet .
mr president , i welcome the arias ca&ntilde;ete report .
i welcome the agreement and i welcome the fact that the commission was able to reach this agreement with morocco .
it was a very difficult position and i therefore am delighted about the new agreement .
having said that , it would be wrong of me not to draw attention to the future of these fishing agreements .
the morocco agreement is the most important one .
we must not allow in the future huge expenditure on a commodity that perhaps can be caught in other ways .
we must recognise the fact that we have acp agreements and other developing country arrangements .
within this parliament we may have difficulty in looking at this overall relationship .
i believe that we have to be careful in the future , and this may have implications for our spanish colleagues and their fishermen .
i am only putting that down as a marker because i believe that the cost of fish is going to be an important aspect in future agreements .
mr president , madam commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i think we must welcome the fact that this fisheries agreement between the european union and morocco has been reached .
mr president , a cooperation agreement on fisheries has been concluded with morocco .
it cannot in fact assume the right to exploit a space not subject to the exclusive sovereignty or jurisdiction of non-member countries .
the moroccan fishing zones provided for in the agreement should be demarcated in accordance with the rules of international law , particularly with those of the united nations conventions on the law of the sea .
as the fishing agreement now stands , the riches of the western sahara territorial waters do not benefit the saharan people .
i therefore ask the commission , who negotiated this agreement , to make sure that international law is respected .
one concerns morocco itself .
remember the example of namibia , where there were mainly eu boats operating before the namibians could settle their own fishing policy .
we committed terrible things in those waters off the coast of namibia when there was no control .
let us remember those things and let us now pass the agreement , but remembering those points .
mr president , i wish to thank mr arias ca&ntilde;ete for his report .
as he normally does , he did a very thorough and informative job on this .
i support the agreement as well , because at this time it was politically , socially and economically important in many regions in spain .
obviously i am concerned that parliament is not getting its full constitutional rights in relation to these agreements .
ecu 500 m is a significant amount of money and we are entitled to codecision-making under the maastricht treaty .
whatever international obligations we have i believe should be subordinated to that constitutional right .
i am impressed by the figures that robin teverson gave us in relation to the cost per job and per vessel of this agreement .
they are relevant and we should take these things into account .
what could it do for aquaculture and tourism infrastructure ?
you could probably attract about ecu 2 , 000 million in investment and it might , at the end of the day , give greater economic benefits than it has in this way .
not just at this time but for the future , that is the way we ought to be thinking .
because , as james provan and others said , we cannot build a long-term fisheries policy on this sort of agreement when , obviously , there are many factors that will not be there in ten years ' time .
so we should look at the other prospects for helping the peripheral regions in a different way .
secondly , its articulation with the association agreement in the overall framework of a euro-mediterranean agreement with that country .
we are now going to be issuing an opinion five months after the agreement was approved and more than four months after it entered into force .
this situation , madam commissioner , cannot be accepted and should not be a practice in the future , as the european parliament has repeatedly stated and as you well know .
on the whole , these guidelines are in keeping with the proposals which we defended throughout , in terms of this agreement , even though they really fall short of what is necessary .
the negotiation of this fisheries agreement stemmed from another agreement , a trade agreement with morocco , which is quite clearly harmful for portugal .
mr president , most representatives of the andalusian fisheries sector say that this agreement is the best of those signed between the european union and morocco - simply the best .
let me sincerely congratulate the negotiators who have certain been a homogeneous team , which has acted firmly and calmly , waiting for the right time , and in the end decisively .
they have done well .
it is an agreement which was so difficult but which has turned out so well . and it is an agreement which allows us to continue , improve and advance our relations with morocco .
i notice that mr arias ca&ntilde;ete is not saying what he was saying before the spanish elections .
mr president , the first assessment we must make is of the agreement itself .
the compromise achieved is the best possible .
and this is the best agreement which could have been achieved in view of the stubborn and tough attitude maintained by the moroccan negotiators .
we must also congratulate the commission on having sent parliament a copy of the agreement as soon as it was signed .
that act is nothing more or less than one more sign of the spirit of transparency and collaboration with parliament which the commission and particularly commissioner bonino is advocating .
there is another aspect which is also worth stressing .
the council understood in its proposal that this agreement has important budgetary implications for the union . it therefore decided to consult parliament by means of the assent procedure .
that possibility constitutes an important recognition of the european parliament 's rights and powers .
we must therefore vote for this proposal for a decision .
in this case , although the agreement is rough at the edges , the union has worked for an agreement which was the least bad of the various options .
as the commissioner is present i should like to make a brief remark which may only touch on this debate , but is important in these times .
this is the anchovy season : portugal has ceded to france 6 000 tonnes from zone 9 which are being fished by france in zone 8 .
i ask you to act with your usual zeal and energy to prevent this frontal attack on this sometimes - but only sometimes - sacrosanct principle of relative stability .
many thanks and congratulations on the agreement , madam commissioner .
mr president , commissioner , it is kind of you to let me speak too on behalf of the committee on budgets .
like mr arias ca&ntilde;ete , who spoke for the committee on fisheries , i welcome the application of assent procedure on behalf of the committee on budgets .
that simplified our work in the committees .
nevertheless , i must once again voice serious criticism on behalf of the committee on budgets about the decision-making procedure .
this breach of contract by the council in curtailing the rights vested in parliament as part of the budgetary authority is even more serious than in the previous cases , since the agreement with morocco has considerable financial implications .
ecu 500 million is not chickenfeed .
i therefore protest formally against the systematic bypassing of this house and insist once again upon our contractually guaranteed participatory rights .
nevertheless , in view of the great importance we all attach to this agreement , the committee on budgets approved it unanimously .
we made our approval subject to three provisos , however .
secondly , we expect the council to make a formal undertaking that it will keep us officially informed of all negotiations on agreements and protocols , new or renewed .
we also call on the council and commission to reach a modus vivendi with parliament on the provisional application of agreements .
let me begin by thanking , on my own behalf and on that of the commission , the european parliament for the dispatch with which it has drawn up its opinion .
my personal thanks also for this important element after a year of very difficult and very complex negotiations which necessitated the intervention of the president of the commission .
i wish to take this opportunity also to thank those high-level political representatives , including those from morocco , who worked for this agreement finally to be achieved .
it is , in my view , a satisfactory and balanced agreement , things being what they are .
above all , it places the emphasis on an issue important to us , that of the conservation and sound management of stocks .
it is an agreement that provides important and innovative data as far as controls are concerned .
and so , in terms of controls to improve the conservation of fish stocks , this is an agreement that contains important new elements .
i have to emphasize two points on this occasion : parliament has recognized that article 228 has been applied for the first time , albeit somewhat tardily .
every institution has therefore to take responsibility for the delays and for paying due attention .
i wanted to talk a little about the financial problem and the cost / benefit issue .
for instance , it will be apparent from the dossier we are preparing that there are agreements that are in principle less expensive but , unfortunately , they are not being taken advantage of .
i therefore think that for all of those reasons , the quimper meeting is an important factor in providing us all with information .
a further important element in this agreement is that it includes a formal undertaking to reduce the dependence of the community fishing fleet on moroccan waters .
that is a specific undertaking that we have entered into because we take the view that to be 100 % dependent on a third country is not economically sustainable in any sector , including , obviously the fisheries sector .
let me finally draw your attention to another factor : many honourable members have raised the political issue of the relationship with morocco - the sahara issue and others .
i wish also to mention another point that almost everyone spoke of : the problem of the provisional application of the fisheries agreements .
imagine if , in november , we had said to our fishermen that they should stay in port until february or march awaiting an opinion on provisional application !
that would not have contributed greatly to improving the understanding of many important sections of public opinion in regard to the european institutions .
i believe , however , that trying to conclude balanced agreements founded on partnership - wherever possible and necessary - is the right approach .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at noon tomorrow .
health monitoring
what is involved here is making it possible to take stock of the work that has been done by comparing the results obtained in the different countries .
that will enable us to provide the member states with factors for assessment on which to base measures to prevent and treat the more serious diseases .
you have to be informed before you can take a decision !
the data to be compared needs then to be put together to provide a full picture of the health of europeans and , therefore , the diseases that have effectively to be combated .
faced with those difficulties , the solutions that appear in the programme are far from clear , in fact they are frequently hesitant and vague .
there is a reluctance to employ the word ' harmonization ' because , as you know , article 129 of the maastricht treaty prohibits the harmonization of health systems .
mr president , the committee on budgets has considered the proposal for the adoption of a community action programme on health monitoring and has , obviously , looked more particularly at the financial aspects .
mr president , in my opinion mr poggiolini deserves the socialist group 's congratulations on the sincerity and enthusiasm with which he has prepared his report .
in addition he has been kind enough to accept practically all amendments in committee and i thank him for that .
i also congratulate the commission .
as mr poggiolini has said , this programme is extremely important .
i should also like to stress that this must lead to the creation of a permanent structure for health monitoring .
but it is the first of the four to have a differential element .
and the position is that it is not an addition to the actions of the 15 member states but there is a joint management since it lays down a structure for cooperation between the member states .
it is a matter of a co-decision procedure enriched , moreover , by contributions from the commission , the committee on the environment and the committee on budgets .
finally i should like to thank the commission for its special sensitivity to parliament 's view .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , let me thank mr poggioloni for this excellent report .
the harmonization of data is essential to provide each country with a basis of comparison to enable it to review its own health policy and to allow each state to react more quickly and effectively to rectify undesirable trends .
data protection and security of data are paramount requirements .
for that reason , anonymity must be ensured when data are passed on .
that is very important to us as liberals .
these efforts are consistent with article 129 of the treaty , which enshrines the aim of ensuring a high level of human health protection .
we feel unable to support amendment no 32 , since we take the view that countries must also be prepared to play their part in financing such measures .
the programme itself is too poorly funded to allow for financial support to member states .
amendment no 40 - a relisting of the categories of data to be collected - is really a painstaking administrative task that is for the commission to undertake and not the european parliament .
mr president , the confederal group of the european united left - nordic green left supports mr poggiolini 's report because it is a substantial improvement on what the commission submitted .
and it is true that both the commission communication and the report constitute important progress and we welcome that .
in any event , there are three omissions in the report which we should like to mention so that they may be incorporated in the future if appropriate .
the first omission is related to the social context in which this report is made : it seems that the health of europeans is likely to deteriorate for three reasons .
secondly the difficulty of a health information network working well throughout europe when we are seeing a re-privatization of medicine and the resultant difficulties that brings for gathering information through the public system .
thirdly the threat of various epidemics which - as we are seeing - may come from russia and neighbouring countries .
the who has called attention to this and we must therefore improve the situation with regard to our health information .
finally the third omission relates to information .
otherwise we shall simply be collecting information for publication but not for action .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if there is any single sure belief shared by all industrialized countries , it is that fundamental choices must now be made over a public health policy .
this is what the commission 's document proposes and that is the message our rapporteur is conveying with some skill in amending that document .
parliament intended to propose a fully-fledged european health observatory like that set up in other fields .
the majority of the council preferred not to go beyond simple coordination .
the commission is therefore proposing to us a rather vague public health monitoring system , but whatever form this new instrument takes , it must be efficient and operational .
parliament wanted the health professionals , the ngos and the whole paramedical establishment to be more closely associated .
my feeling is that this wish has not been taken into account in the commission 's document .
thus , the commission proposes to analyse the state of health of european citizens , to evaluate the impact of community action programmes and to supply member states with information on that state of health .
mr president , we are discussing the proposed programme of community action on health monitoring .
the programme was already announced in the commission 's communication on the framework for community action in the field of public health .
it also responds to several resolutions tabled by members and by the council .
the general aim of the programme is to contribute to the establishment of a high-quality policy-oriented monitoring system in order to ensure a high level of health protection as required by article 129 of the treaty .
more specifically we intend the programme to serve three purposes .
first , the system should help to monitor health and health determinants throughout the union and permit comparisons with third countries .
second , the system should facilitate planning , monitoring , implementation and evaluation of community programmes and actions .
third , it should provide member states with comparative health indicators .
the answer is quite simple .
the data that currently exists is neither comprehensive nor comparable . therefore , it does not permit the monitoring of health and health determinants in the european union in a meaningful , useful and effective way .
this point was very much made by mr poggiolini .
in this way we hope to provide the maximum added value .
how can we do this ?
we will establish a set of health indicators which will provide the necessary information to establish the above-mentioned objectives and we will then develop a network for the collection and dissemination of the data needed for the indicators .
in the light of the existing technological capabilities we are planning to rely in the main on telematics for this purpose .
the interchange of data between the administration 's programmes , that is the ida programme , should provide us with the appropriate technical infrastructure for this network .
we all know that the availability of data , even comparable high-quality data , is not sufficient to ensure their usefulness .
we therefore also plan a number of activities related to the analysis of this particular data .
in particular , we intend to use the data to prepare our annual health status report , the first of which will be transmitted to you a little later this year .
we also intend to rely on data from the system for the analysis and the preparation of our annual report on the health requirements in other policies which was initiated last year .
these reports are currently being prepared using a variety of sources , the quality of which still leaves quite a lot to be desired .
i should now like to turn to the report itself and the amendments but before doing that i want to thank mr poggiolini and the members of the committees who have helped prepare this report .
they have done it with very great speed and for that i am very grateful .
turning now to the 47 amendments , i can inform you that the commission is in a position to accept 28 of these amendments either wholly or in part .
we accept fully amendments nos 12 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 23 , 24 and 29 .
we accept partially amendments nos 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 to 11 , 13 , 19 , 33 to 40 and 42 .
six of them are too restrictive . they are nos 4 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 and 38 .
six of them are not expressed in appropriate operational terms or may lead to some confusion if not properly worded .
they are nos 19 , 33 , 35 , 36 , 37 and 40 .
four of them are included elsewhere , namely nos 3 , 6 , 34 and 39 .
our position on some of these amendments deserves some explanation .
in particular , i refer to amendments nos 6 and 34 which concern the european health observatory , which was referred to by mr caudron and mr poggiolini .
i would draw attention to a promise i made at the conciliation meeting in december of 1995 that the commission would consider the idea of a health observatory very carefully .
any further decision regarding the actual establishment of an observatory will have to await the outcome of these deliberations .
with regard to amendment no 9 , we cannot accept the latter part which concerns the support for improved databases in member states .
pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity , this is a matter for the member states themselves .
for the same reason we cannot accept the latter part of amendment no 38 concerning the support for analysis of the cost-effectiveness of member states ' health systems .
mrs gredler referred to this matter in her contribution .
turning to the amendments which we cannot accept . the reasons for rejection are as follows .
seven amendments are not acceptable for legal reasons . two - nos 21 and 31 - because we cannot introduce into the programme the kind of obligations envisaged .
one - no 15 - because it does not conform with the precise wording of article 129 . four because they are inconsistent with the analogous provisions of the other public health programmes .
they are amendments nos 43 , 44 , 46 and 47 . two amendments are rejected because they fall outside the scope of the programme .
these are nos 26 , 27 and 28 . the remaining two amendments - nos 22 and 41 , concerning the size of the budget , cause considerable difficulty .
i should like to elaborate a little on the reasons for refusing some of the above-mentioned amendments . it is important that members understand why we are doing it .
against this background members will recall that in the case of the previous three health programmes , the budgetary allocations were only finally decided at the conciliation procedure .
amendment nos 2 and 21 which refer to the establishment of targets by member states are also unacceptable . firstly , this programme is a community health monitoring programme which is intended to monitor health trends .
in closing , i express my thanks again to mr poggiolini for his efforts to improve the community 's action on health monitoring generally .
our shared efforts will lead to a valuable and productive programme .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at noon tomorrow .
alzheimer 's disease - health card - blood safety
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , it is our common experience that , as people get older , we frequently come across cases variously defined as senile dementia or cerebral arteriosclerosis .
the initial symptoms are common to other diseases , for some of which there is an effective treatment , so that an early and differentiated diagnosis is crucial to avoid confusing the different illnesses .
it can take seven or eight years to progress from the initial symptoms to the terminal stage .
all of this means that the disease will spread .
it is estimated that of those aged 85 and over - and we are starting to see many 85 year-olds - one elderly person in 4 , that is 25 % , will be suffering from alzheimer 's disease .
this resolution seeks to encourage - effectively , we hope - the commission to draw up a multiannual programme of funding and initiatives concerning everything that can possibly be done to help families and sufferers .
clearly , the member states will have to understand that , particularly in the terminal stage , it is not possible to leave it to families always and exclusively to bear the burden of this tragic illness .
that funding has been used for the purposes i have listed and also been made available to the different non-governmental associations , alzheimer europe , for example , which brings together no fewer than 18 national associations .
the very important question i put to the commission asking how that ecu 5 million is to be used elicited what amounts to a very general answer from commissioner flynn .
however , we note that the commission anticipates attending the important conference to be held in ireland on 21 and 22 november next .
one important step in that direction will be the programme that we are urging the commission to provide .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the health card is an issue which has been of concern to the house for more than 15 years .
we consider that a health card would make it possible to prevent serious incidents involving the administration of ineffective or dangerous treatments , particularly in cases of chronic illness , serious illness or allergy .
the purpose of the health card is in fact to facilitate diagnosis , prevent the administration of inappropriate treatment or medication and cut the time spent on administration .
we are , of course , in agreement with the main points in the communication , but in our report we lay stress on certain aspects that appear to us to be essential .
the plan must also institute follow-up monitoring of the blood samples taken so that they can , if necessary , be traced back to the donors .
this is ' traceability ' .
but it is not enough just to select the donors .
the products taken from them must also be tested .
for this , what are called ' infectious markers ' must be defined and used , thus making it possible to recognize the possible presence of any dangerous microbes or parasites that could be transmitted to recipients .
next , it is important to define and harmonize throughout the european union the methods of treating , conserving , storing and handling blood products , to provide the highest possible guarantee of safety .
all these measures , harmonized throughout all member states , will allow blood products to circulate freely throughout the whole european union .
finally , blood transfusion activities and the transfusion chain must be continuously monitored in order to detect immediately any accident or contamination , to find its cause and to prevent any repetition : this is ' haemovigilance ' .
the second aim of this communication is to ensure that there are sufficient quantities of blood and blood products to respond to the needs of citizens of the union .
there are two possible ways of achieving this : either by reducing the quantities required or by increasing the quantities taken .
the professionals in blood transfusion - the nurses , doctors and technical staff - must become proficient in this rational use of blood products : hence the need for appropriate education and teaching in the training of students .
these products are mainly supplied by private companies , who use paid donors in order to make a profit since this is the only way they can obtain enough of them .
the european union also has such private companies which must not be condemned to disappear to the advantage of public institutions which would then have a monopoly .
one way of ensuring that these private companies do not pay their donors would be to compensate them .
the two vital aims would then be achieved : the safety and self-sufficiency of blood transfusion in the european union .
there is no doubt that medical and scientific research into this disease calls for a major commitment , considerable effort and growing financial investment .
we are obliged to find increasingly appropriate solutions to deal with the problems arising from alzheimer 's and other diseases related to ageing populations .
it is for the member states of the european union to define certain policies and strategies so that the whole problem related to neuro-degenerative diseases can be tackled in their medical , social , financial and other aspects .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the two aims being pursued are indeed the restoration and strengthening of confidence in the safety of the transfusion chain and the achievement of self-sufficiency in blood .
however , it is not very easy to accomplish all this as we find ourselves doing away with provisions which obstruct the free movement of goods and at the same time taking steps to guarantee maximum safety .
common standards will therefore have to be set .
but it is worth pausing a little and looking at these common standards .
and , just as farmers ' income has to be preserved , but not at any price , we should expect strict regulations to be put into place .
they should not be over-fussy , but they must protect us .
on the same subject , barely a fortnight ago in this very chamber , we had a debate on in vitro diagnostic devices : serological tests .
the monitoring and regulation required provoked a general outcry , precisely in the name of the free movement of goods .
yet only a few days after that debate , 50 000 hiv tests were recognized as defective by their manufacturers and the tests will have to be started all over again .
strict regulation and monitoring would have protected us .
we must demand that a standard file be drawn up on all donors .
we must demand that blood-saving techniques be developed .
we must encourage research on synthetic products and substitutes .
we must demand the training and retraining of doctors and nurses ; we must demand traceability and haemovigilance networks .
finally , in connection with the haemovigilance network , a truly harmonized european system should be able to rely on the regulatory framework already established in directive 89 / 381 .
the european parliament already asked for precisely this in its resolution of november 1993 .
i hope we shall be able to remember this after three years .
mr president , the european parliament did not wait until the maastricht treaty was adopted to place constant emphasis on all public health issues .
as mr leopardi reminded us , the house has discussed the health card on many occasions - but we are now lagging behind .
turning to alzheimer 's disease - we have said this on many occasions , and professor poggiolini put it very well : the ageing of the population is an achievement of the health system .
but just as the ageing of the population increases health costs , it is similarly bound to increase the incidence of agerelated disease .
here again we are therefore lagging behind .
as regards the communication on blood , i have to say that since i have been a member of this house , this is , i believe , the third time we have discussed this issue in the chamber .
well , here again we are lagging behind .
here again i believe that , except for those involved in the work , no-one would believe that here in europe we are not self-sufficient ; no-one can accept that blood in europe is not safe .
in addition , the knowledge of those working in the health needed to be improved .
this precious gift must not be wasted and we need therefore to maximize and make the best use of resources .
measures must be taken to reduce the number of transfusions , increasing the use of blood provided by the patient himself .
at present , there is virtually no treatment for the disease and no cure either .
it is inevitably a terminal disease .
at european level it is now estimated that over 8 million - equivalent to approximately 2 % of the over-65 age group - will be afflicted by alzheimer 's disease by the year 2000 .
of course , this figure does not take into account the difficulties of the families of the alzheimer 's sufferers , who are profoundly affected by the disease , both emotionally and practically .
all social life is disrupted and often financial and legal problems ensue .
in such cases there is tremendous pressure on those caring for those suffering from the disease .
in ireland the invaluable work carried out by the alzheimer 's society of ireland has made a significant contribution to supporting alzheimer 's sufferers and their families .
as europe 's demographic profile becomes older , it is clear that alzheimer 's disease will become an even greater social and health problem .
the commission must put in place , as a matter of some urgency , a comprehensive programme of measures to combat the disease and provide for more resources under its biomed programme for joint research into the disease .
regarding research , the commission also has an important role in coordinating member state research into the disease and ensuring the optimum results from such research .
it is important to heighten public awareness of this disease and to provide information to affected families .
finally , it is important that the european union give practical recognition to the invaluable work of carers who live each day with the traumatic effects of this disease .
in this regard , the allocation of funding for carer support , including respite facilities , must be urgently considered by the commission .
mr president , i thank the three rapporteurs for their excellent reports .
since i do not have much time , i shall go straight to the heart of the matter .
i do not believe there is enough money available for the fight against alzheimer 's disease , for establishing specialized out-patient facilities or even hospital wards .
this money is not to be used for the absolutely essential research into creutzfeldt-jakob disease either .
the commission ought to consider where else it could obtain these resources .
nor do i think that schoolchildren are the appropriate target group for public information campaigns on alzheimer ' s .
i do not think that we as a group can support amendment no 1 , because it is our view that research on foetal tissue is entirely necessary and should be permissible .
with regard to mr leopardi 's report on the health card , i have to say that free choice must be paramount .
my group will not be able to approve the report as a whole if the european parliament seeks to force this benefit upon people .
we also believe that the persons concerned should be given the opportunity to delete all stored data themselves .
thirdly , this card will be a great aid to quick and effective action if it is not overloaded with information in such a way as to make important details unrecognizable to the consulting physician .
so in my view there is no need to enter the names of medicines to which the cardholder has shown no reaction .
if i take medication at some time for athlete 's foot and it has no adverse effects , that information has no place on a health card designed for use in an emergency .
we must know from the outset what is more important to us .
social security or other health insurance cover results in my opinion in twotiered health care .
i believe it can be dangerous for the person concerned if he cannot immediately prove who is financing his treatment .
in our modern society , we have conquered some traditional illnesses but others have come into being .
the solution to alzheimer 's , like some tumours and certain types of cardiovascular disease , is certainly prevention .
to prevent that form of infection it is therefore vital that we pay the greatest attention to the difficulties involved in transfusion .
moreover , we have seen that , at certain times , the tests involve risks because they produce false negatives .
in the light of those circumstances , we need therefore to reinforce the preventive criteria and set in place all possible arrangements to protect our citizens .
mr president , mr poggiolini 's report deals with a problem which has hitherto not been much in the public eye : alzheimer 's disease .
the number of people over 60 suffering from this disease is growing alarmingly .
patients become completely dependent as a result of their illness .
care for such people often falls upon the shoulders of members of the family and neighbours and becomes a serious burden .
this report therefore rightly calls attention to alzheimer 's disease and its consequences and presses for further research , the provision of more information and increased funding by the european union and the member states .
such an illness and its social , mental and economic consequences cannot and must not be played down .
it is therefore with due deference and prudence that i put forward the following ideas , more or less inspired by an observation in mr poggiolini 's explanatory statement .
at one point he refers in particular to the fact that developing countries are little affected by this illness because life expectancy there is too low .
that is poignant and also significant .
longevity has become normal in our welfare society .
that is something to be grateful for .
but it is striking that in our society the current ideology projects only the image of the ideal person as young and healthy .
we are scared of old age , sickness and death .
the crux of this problem naturally lies in the loss of the purpose of this earthly existence .
without the hope of the gospel death is always final .
a disease such as alzheimer 's certainly needs to be tackled .
but let us learn to accept that sickness and old age form part of our existence .
in our society we seem to want to detach that from our daily existence .
by that we deny the value of our fellow human beings with their own place in creation . because that is what they are : fellow human beings , nothing more , nothing less .
mr president , i should like first of all to thank mr poggiolini on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists .
he has collaborated closely with us and has seriously considered and adopted many of our amendments .
what are we discussing with alzheimer 's , since that is the report i now want to consider ?
we are talking about a question .
i should actually like to keep the word problem out of the discussion . i have tried to do that too in an amendment to the annex .
it is not a problem but a question . that goes also for what mr blokland has just said too .
i think it is more a question .
what are we faced with in our society ?
and it tallies , as other speakers have also said . it tallies that europe is the continent of the elderly .
anyone who looks at the figures for old age in all continents notices that europe will have by far the greatest number of old people in the coming decades .
thus the young have the future , the elderly have the future , you should say .
there is something positive about that . but at the same time it brings with it issues and difficulties , and that is what we are faced with in this report .
to name one specific successful model , the alzheimer telephone .
our group cannot accepts amendments nos 1 and 3 , mr president , where there is reference to the use of foetuses for research .
we shall abstain on amendment no 1 .
it is i suppose a relevant subject , but not in this report , rather in a report in which we are discussing ethical limits in research .
mr president , may i begin by congratulating and complimenting mr poggiolini on the excellent reports he has drawn up .
i mean that genuinely and sincerely . i think it can be seen here that a doctor , actually a president of the italian specialist medical association , can also be a very good politician .
i greatly respect that .
in fact i want to include all the reports .
first of all there is the medical card .
it is a perfect initiative . i think a card of that kind may be of vital importance for the holder if he or she needs medical help abroad .
those travelling on holiday or on business can count on medical help and diagnosis without any language problem .
it should also be possible to make immediate contact with home in case of illness , since all those data can be stored on the card .
i think and hope that commissioner flynn is ready , now that we have the new state of technology , to take over this initiative which has been with parliament for such a terribly long time .
i turn now to alzheimer ' s .
mrs van putten and mr blokland have each spoken about it .
we must recognize that something must be done at european level to see how we can best find a joint solution . so that means that we must coordinate research at european level , exchange experience and so on .
last but not least , i should like to give mr cabrol my best thanks for his excellent report on the standardization and safety of blood tests .
in his well-known expert way mr cabrol has been willing to adopt those amendments too and everything has been approved .
thank you to the rapporteurs . they have really done excellent work .
mr president , i should like to say something about problems of safety in transfusion that should also appear on the agenda of a council planned by the irish presidency next autumn .
this is an extremely serious subject , when the memory of the controversies provoked by the contaminated blood catastrophe is still with us .
it seems that a few residual stocks still remain - some use of them has been mentioned , particularly by the armed forces - and for several years have escaped all safety measures .
it would appear that everything is not yet clear in this matter .
quite apart from the problem of aids , there are still said to be problems relating to hepatitis .
mr president , the affair at the centre of professor cabrol 's excellent report , i.e. that of contaminated blood , has not taught us a lesson .
what has led to contamination by bovine spongiform encephalopathy , to aids through contaminated blood and to creutzfeldt-jakob disease through contaminated meat , has arisen from a single cause : ideology .
in the business of contaminated blood and contaminated meat , capitalist companies have privatized the profits and nationalized the compensation for damages .
the polluter has not been the payer , it is the taxpayer who has paid .
mr president , i should like to congratulate mr poggiolini on his report .
i am particularly pleased to see this report on alzheimer 's come to fruition because it was a motion put down by me some 18 months ago that has led to this report .
as we have heard , there are an estimated 3.5 million people in the european union with alzheimer 's disease .
it is the most common , chronic , terminal illness among our older people .
in my own country of scotland , which has a population of five million , there are an estimated 61 , 000 people suffering from dementia .
it is reckoned that this figure will rise to around 73 , 000 by the early part of next century .
dementia is not just an old person 's disease .
the one serious point that mr martinez made is that we are learning that from some of the new cases of cjd .
there are between 2 , 000 and 3 , 000 people in scotland alone between the ages of 30 and 65 suffering from dementia .
dementia knows no social , national or economic boundaries .
therefore i believe it is ripe for action at the european level .
i hope the european commission will consider using this report as the basis for what could be called ' the first european action plan on dementia ' .
we need to do something at the european level to improve training and the quality of standards for the care of the sufferers .
the commission could use its good offices to bring together health and social care experts to disseminate good practice .
we could also use some of our existing research programmes such as biomed to play a greater role in fostering and motivating research in this particular area .
this seems to be a legitimate role for the union and the commission to play .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the health-policy experts are having their say this evening .
i wish to thank all of my honourable colleagues and in particular i should like to make some comments on mr leopardi 's report .
the quest for a european health card is nothing new in the european parliament ; back in 1981 it was on the parliamentary agenda , culminating in the so-called recommendation of the european community .
but at that time the health ministers were not even prepared to get together .
those were the days when health policy was dealt with as a purely national concern .
we have now moved on a bit .
firstly , parliament has a right of initiative , and i hope that the commissioner will make use of that to play an active part in this endeavour .
secondly , maastricht has given us coordination in the domain of health policy .
now my question today is addressed primarily to the commissioner .
what are the obstacles that have prevented coordination among the member states with regard to the health card in the past , and what can we do to remove these obstacles ?
i have tabled two amendments , and therein lie two points of importance to the president as well .
my first amendment was intended as an improvement , but the motion was so disastrously mistranslated that the german text says something quite different to the french and italian versions .
so misunderstandings have naturally arisen , since my amendment was based on the german text and is therefore somewhat incomprehensible to the rapporteur , who is italian , because it does not refer to his text .
in other words , communication broke down here , which is why problems have arisen with the amendment .
that is why my amendment seeks to exclude the issues of occupational diseases and social security cover , because they are so complex that we shall have to wait another hundred years for such a package .
i should indeed be grateful to the commissioner if he would tell us which elements he is able to endorse and what can be done to ensure that the health card will actually be introduced soon .
mr president , i congratulate mr cabrol on his report .
a man with his vast medical experience is a worthy rapporteur on blood safety .
the european commission 's communication on blood safety and self-sufficiency in the european union represents a considered attempt to restore confidence and to establish a specifically european response to the matter .
the commission must also urge member states to take appropriate action to achieve self-sufficiency on the basis of unpaid , voluntary donations .
for many decades austria has had an exemplary system of blood and plasma collection , which i should like to outline .
the mixed system comprises red cross branches , hospitals and industry .
the system , which has evolved over a period of time , consists of blood-donor centres run by non-profit organizations and of private plasmapheresis centres where plasma is collected for industrial fractionation .
back in 1975 a special law was passed to regulate plasmapheresis , the first such legislation in the world .
this figure was achieved by around 14 000 donors in 13 plasmapheresis centres .
the voluntary nature of these donations and the fact that the donors receive no payment are regarded as self-evident .
the plasma is not bought from the donor , although plasma donors in austria naturally receive appropriate compensation for their time and for travel to and from the centres .
each country has its own system , and all of them work more or less effectively .
we must accept that , in the realm of blood and plasma collection , the systems vary and operate on mixed bases .
whether these are commercial or nonprofitmaking , the aims for europe remain the same , namely efficiency and selfsufficiency .
mr president , i wish to bring to the attention of commissioner flynn the kind of problems experienced by european citizens which have been brought to me by a constituent .
a constituent 's son went to greece and suffered an injury there .
of course he presented his e111 form when he returned to the united kingdom but was told that the receipt which he had obtained from the doctor was invalid because it did not contain a perforation on it .
imagine the problem that young man faced : exhausted , tired and upset , he was required to insist upon a receipt with perforations on it .
the fact that he did not return that receipt with the appropriate perforations to the united kingdom meant that he was unable to obtain reimbursement .
now that inhibits , i am sure you will agree , free movement .
therefore , i would like you to look upon the proposal for a health card in the light of the time that we have already spent on this as a parliament .
you will recall this is one of a series of resolutions , the first of which was in 1981 . so we have been asking for this for a very long time .
indeed , mr leopardi , in an excellent report , says that much in part of the resolution .
this is the kind of thing that the socialist group has already designed and would be of great value to every european citizen when making their way round the single market .
we ask the commission to come forward with this and we hope very much that the commissioner will respond in the way i have described .
mr president , we have just heard from mr david martin a number of figures about people with alzheimer 's disease in the european union .
i should like to focus them still more specifically , mr president .
at present the european parliament has 626 members . the average age is about 45 .
one third of members are 55 or older .
statistically , within ten years five to fifteen of our fellow-members will be suffering from alzheimer 's disease .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is to be hoped that within ten years there will be efficacious therapies and medicines to prevent alzheimer 's and similar diseases and if possible to cure them .
but that depends amongst other things on the readiness of the european union to invest in the fight against such afflictions .
a community action programme with a special and not merely symbolical budget heading ought to be able to supplement the existing community initiatives and coordinate the campaigns started by the member states up to a certain level .
it goes without saying that the member states have a primary responsibility , particularly where reimbursement of medical expenses and social contributions are concerned .
one final point , mr president , we must not play patients off against one another on budgetary grounds or compare one patient with another .
but as rapporteur for community programmes on behalf of the elderly i must sincerely ask that this group of the population should not be forgotten .
in the year 2000 there will be more than 50 million of them in the european union , so more than one million alzheimer patients .
as a social personalist and a christian democrat i earnestly plead for a european approach to alzheimer 's disease .
that is a principle which should be recognized by certain member states which are still sceptical about a joint approach to certain problems as serious or as important as the three which are before the house today .
congratulations to mr poggiolini , mr leopardi and mr cabrol for their excellent work in which they consider respectively :
the health card , which must never , i venture to stress , become an obstacle to the movement of persons .
it must be made very clear that the health card is a voluntary matter .
it is something that will allow easier passage across internal borders and will facilitate freedom of movement and not act as a second passport or a second requirement .
bureaucracy must not turn such an interesting initial idea into one more obstruction or one more compulsory document .
blood transfusions , which are a major problem today .
they are a fully successful tissue transplant and therefore an extraordinary therapeutic tool .
without prejudice to continual progress in self-transfusion i think that the approximation of member states ' rules is a very interesting step .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should also like to comment on mr poggiolini 's report on alzheimer 's disease .
let me begin by associating myself with the thanks that have been expressed to mr poggiolini .
he has certainly submitted a very good report , which deals with various aspects of the issue .
as a medic , i have also met patients with alzheimer 's , and i am aware of the extent of the problem .
i believe that mr poggiolini has adopted the correct approach and that the other speakers , such as mrs van putten , have set the right tone in this debate .
for that reason , i should like to restrict myself to one problem that particularly concerns me , namely the question of research .
where do the problems lie , and where are the boundaries we must not cross ?
this is a real danger and not mere scaremongering , and i believe we should bear that amendment in mind here today .
it was adopted at the time by a large parliamentary majority but was sadly rejected by the commission .
i should like to urge commissioner flynn to examine whether this idea of parliament 's to rule out any exertion of pressure is not in fact a sound one .
i believe we have the opportunity here to reaffirm that we are most definitely in favour of research but that the limit is reached when people start to be exploited as sources of raw material .
the green group in the european parliament has tabled an amendment rejecting such research altogether .
parliament will surely be unable to agree to that .
what i am tabling on behalf of the group of the european people 's party , however , is a compromise , and i ask you all to support our amendment no 3 to the poggiolini report .
so i wish at the outset to thank the commissioner and the commission for its communication , and the rapporteur , our colleague christian cabrol , for the quality of his work .
i want to make it clear that i support the communication , the report and the majority of the proposals , provided of course that some detailed changes are made .
while clarification was essential , the need to stress the safety of the donor and the recipient was even more so .
it is now imperative to promote the giving of blood by providing wide-ranging and precise information about blood , blood products and their use in treatment .
harmonization of the rules for the transfusion process , particularly as regards the selection of donors and screening tests , is absolutely indispensable and urgent throughout europe .
finally , this calls for the creation of a european organization for monitoring blood safety .
this would be an enormous advance for the citizens of europe .
the question of voluntary unpaid blood donation is very familiar to me : i am myself a blood donor .
the donors and their associations have suffered greatly at all levels from the effects of aids and contamination through transfusion .
today , they need to be recognized , encouraged and supported .
in conclusion , if tomorrow we are to ensure optimum safety and european selfsufficiency - often a decisive factor in achieving safety - we must act still more quickly and still more firmly .
the communication from the commission executive and christian cabrol 's report should help us in this .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , at this late hour i have brought along evidence to show that it has been worth staying on here this evening .
i have brought my own personal blood-donor card , which is linked to an emergency card and was issued by the austrian red cross .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i must begin by congratulating the three rapporteurs on the excellent quality of their work which lends the european parliament both prestige and value .
i should like to say a few words about what seems to be one of the most positive and future-looking ideas , namely a european health card .
the creation of a european health card is a positive idea and one which is in keeping with the project of european construction , which deserves our wholehearted support .
since i come from a touristic area - the algarve - and since portugal is a country of considerable migration , i think that i am particularly sensitive to the defence of this idea .
the treaty itself commits the european union to responsibility in ensuring a high level of human health protection .
indeed , at present , there are technical conditions for the creation of a european health document which can be accepted by all member states and by the various health system sectors .
this idea is far from a new one and it certainly needs to be developed and accentuated .
it is already ten years since the first council resolution in favour of an emergency health card for europeans , a project which came to nothing .
but now the times are different and this idea is more urgent and there are also greater technical possibilities .
so that is as far as we have got .
mr president , it is interesting that commissioner flynn should have been here earlier today when we were discussing a mainly young people 's problem , namely drugs .
here we are this evening discussing what is mainly a problem which affects the elderly - alzheimer 's and senile dementia .
as has been pointed out , these diseases affect millions of people throughout europe .
in ireland it is estimated that about 25 , 000 are affected .
the programme proposed would serve to initiate coherent policies at european level .
it would coordinate measures at national level and act as a catalyst for measures both in the public and private sectors .
i support the call that has been made for support for the families .
we know that many women have to care for these patients and these patients can be very difficult , troublesome and sometimes violent .
the families also suffer because the legal affairs of these people may have been left in limbo .
deterioration can be very quick and they may be unable to attend to their business affairs .
i also urge the commission to take up parliament 's recommendations for a voluntary european health card system by january 1999 .
finally , in relation to the blood supply , as mr fitzsimons pointed out we had a huge problem in ireland with the hepatitis b scare .
i welcome the commission 's proposals in this regard .
an increase in average life expectancy cannot be viewed as a problem but as a major achievement of our civilization , but that achievement has to be supported by the appropriate political decisions .
in many parts of europe there is excellent experience of work on alzheimer 's , but exchanges of information and the development of trans-national initiative remain at a low level .
that being so , the request that the commission draw up a programme of action to combat alzheimer 's disease and related illnesses is more opportune than ever and has our firm support .
mr president , i am pleased to have the opportunity to present the commission 's position on these three important health-related issues .
i deal first with alzheimer 's disease and mr poggiolini 's report .
this is a very constructive decision .
neuro-degenerative diseases have great social effects .
i am , therefore , particularly happy that your resolution focuses not only on the medical aspects of alzheimer 's disease but also on the loss of cognitive functions and equally on its social impact .
parliament has therefore reinforced the budget available for such diseases .
in 1995 parliament made a special appropriation of ecu 1 million for actions in the field of alzheimer 's disease .
this year it has added ecu 5 m to the public health budget line .
these are the very things you have asked priority to be given to .
so parliament 's report makes the point forcefully that alzheimer 's disease will become an increasingly big problem for european society . that is obvious from the demographic changes that are taking place in our society .
the accelerated ageing of the european population and the particular needs of alzheimer 's patients will increase demands on health and social services .
so there is added value in addressing these increased needs at european level .
the programme of activities which the commission will undertake should provide us with valuable insights into the correct approach to be followed .
given the scale of the challenge , i am sure that this is an issue which will confront us increasingly over the coming years .
i now turn to the question of the european health card and mr leopardi 's report .
the question of the health card has been with us , of course , for a very long time .
some members will even remember previous debates in the house on this particular issue .
both the resolution of 1986 , on the european emergency health card , and the council 's recommendations which concern the use of electronic cards , deal with the issues raised in mr leopardi 's report .
the feasibility of introducing such cards in appropriate forms and conditions has been studied by the commission .
research on the use of the cards in the health sector is currently a major topic in the context of the telematics application and the g7 information society programmes .
since 1986 the commission has held a number of meetings of experts to exchange information and to share experience on the design and the introduction of the health cards and has also supported some pilot projects .
the results have not been particularly encouraging as only a few member states have begun to use them .
however , a number of member states have gradually introduced electronic cards in the social security sector where prospects of a more generalized use are more promising .
moreover , as existing national systems would have to be used in parallel to a community voluntary system , citizens may be required to carry more than one card .
fundamental questions arise at present concerning the protection of the very sensitive medical data that you propose to store on the cards .
this is of particular importance in the case of theft , loss or unauthorized use of the card .
there is also the point concerning the responsibilities of doctors or other health professionals .
can they rely on the data for accuracy and completeness ?
do they understand all of the information therein contained ?
do they know whether it is complete and up to date or do they have to double check all information by running their own examinations to protect themselves from charges of negligence ?
what of the ethical issues , such as blood transfusion acceptance or , indeed , organ donation ?
what exactly it is to be used for and what information is to be stored on it are two of the key questions .
concerning social security : perhaps a more limited application of cards to become an electronic e111 form is feasible .
there is a case for practical solutions , including the mutual recognition of national insurance cards in accordance with the recommendation of the council on 29 september 1989 .
i am very conscious of what mr white says .
the particular card mr white has given to me for my perusal is considerably different from the comprehensive health record card under deliberation and the one that is being talked about here this evening .
perhaps it is something the house might reflect upon .
that might alter the whole attitude and the possibilities .
the main activities which were proposed towards this end were reflected in the council resolution of 2 june 1995 , which encompasses points which were suggested by the commission in its report at that time .
the commission intends to pursue these activities in response to the council invitation and in line with the wishes of members of the house in this area .
in fact , several have already been addressed .
a meeting of experts to discuss issues related to public awareness of blood and blood products is scheduled for next week in rome under the italian presidency .
also , work on a feasibility study on the establishment of a haemo-vigilance network should commence very shortly .
this matter was also mentioned by one of the members .
a project to identify existing practices regarding inspection and accreditation of blood centres in the member states is currently under way .
these are some of the issues we are pursuing at this time .
this has of necessity been only a very brief outline of the commission 's position on these three reports .
these are very important issues . i appreciate that they deserve very wide debate .
i would like to assure the house that my services will pay very close attention to what has been said here this evening .
it is my personal intention to seek progress in all three matters on behalf of the community .
mr president , i should like to respond to the point raised by commissioner flynn .
i am glad he read the card .
he makes a good point in saying that it is more limited than that described in the leopardi report .
that is a technically feasible possibility .
my concern is that if we make things too complicated we will go another ten years .
one of the big problems the commission and parliament face is the tabloid press accusing us of making all sorts of silly legislation which has no relevance to daily life .
this proposal by parliament would be relevant .
therefore , i wonder if you have looked at paragraph 1 ( a ) .
i would refer you to it .
i note what mr white says and i will pay particular attention to that particular aspect .
he and i both agree that the type of thing we are talking about here is a much more limited thing and designed to promote freedom of movement and mobility of people .
that is a slightly different thing and deals with some of the political , legal and technical problems which are associated with the wider data record card .
i take note of what you say .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will be held at 12 noon tomorrow .
( the sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m. )
approval of the minutes
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
this only records part of what i said .
i also stated that rapporteurs , when they accept reports , should undertake to be present at the debate on those reports .
i should like those details to be included in the minutes .
i can testify to what you say , mr fabre-aubrespy .
that will therefore be corrected .
( parliament approved the minutes )
european council in turin
it gives me great pleasure to welcome to the european parliament the presidentin-office of the council , prime minister lamberto dini .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the turin european council marked an important new stage on the road to determining the nature of the process of european integration in the future .
from this point of view the turin european council fully achieved the objective we had set ourselves .
in fact , the agenda for the intergovernmental conference clearly establishes the issues to be given particular attention in negotiating the revision of the treaty .
i consider it significant that it has been possible to achieve unanimous agreement on a list of priorities involving delicate and controversial topics .
other issues scheduled for examination relate to universal access to some categories of essential services , the simplification and consolidation of the text of the treaty which , after successive modifications , has become almost incomprehensible to the citizens .
for these reasons the second major chapter of the conference agenda deals with the representativeness , composition , and operating methods of the institutions .
in an international situation of turbulent change , the promotion and defence of our common values constitutes a profound argument in favour of the process of european integration .
these represent a series of tests for the conference .
although satisfied with the work done and the results obtained at turin , the italian presidency is by no means minimizing the problems that lie ahead of us .
the official documents presented by the governments of some member states confirm the existence of differences , indeed profound differences , on essential issues .
so the conference is going to have a difficult task over the one year period planned for its work .
fully respecting the duty of impartiality incumbent on the presidency , italy will work to promote the emergence of high profile consensus on the various subjects under discussion .
on 22 march the italian government approved its own document on the objectives of the conference .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the madrid european council granted a mandate for defining ways in which the european parliament could be closely associated with the work of the conference .
i shall not go over the various stages of that negotiation again here , as our minister for foreign affairs and under secretary ferraris , who is here today , have already had an opportunity to illustrate its progress .
the ministers for foreign affairs therefore drew up a compromise solution which the turin european council subsequently approved .
this results in an associative model which represents a substantial advance on the previous intergovernmental conference and will allow the european parliament to express its own views on all the issues on the agenda of the conference .
i would like to add my personal thanks for the helpfulness and cooperation shown towards the presidency in the difficult week of negotiations on the method of associating the european parliament with the conference .
one of the purposes of this exercise of revising the treaty is to prepare the union for the enlargement .
we intend to maintain assiduous contact with them and also provide appropriate information to switzerland and the countries of the european economic area .
the turin agenda is realistic yet ambitious .
it will not be easy to meet the commitment to complete the negotiations within the first six months of 1997 .
this consideration has led us to plan a tight schedule of meetings over the next few weeks .
the presidency intends to submit its own interim report to the florence european council to provide a basis for the continuing work of the conference .
the turin european council debated the problems of unemployment and job creation in europe at length .
it discussed the appropriateness of including an ad hoc title on employment objectives in the next treaty : this is one of the options to which the final document opens the way .
the council also dwelt at length on initiatives that could be taken more immediately .
on that basis the european council defined a comprehensive strategy and its content and detail has been successively improved at essen , cannes and madrid .
but we cannot feel satisfied with the results achieved .
at an urgent extraordinary meeting at the beginning of april , the agricultural council adopted a series of measures which bear witness to this commitment to solidarity .
this is a necessary process and will be intensified , but always respecting strict limits and maintaining adequate controls when the protection of public assets , health and the environment is at stake .
( loud and sustained applause )
mr president , mr president-in - office , ladies and gentlemen , on 29 march in turin , the european council launched the intergovernmental conference .
it approved the guidelines for the negotiations and the way in which the european parliament would be involved .
the decisions taken at the european council in madrid were therefore acted upon .
the document 's main aim , which is worth noting , is to ensure that there is consensus on the issues to be dealt with during the conference .
the fact that there was no such agreement before either the single european act or the maastricht treaty should be a salutary reminder .
it is notable that the basic document produced by the european council once again clearly focuses attention on the main problems afflicting our peoples , whilst emphasizing europe 's role in overcoming them .
it would not be acceptable to reform the treaty without first convincing our citizens that europe does really care about their problems .
unemployment , competition , the environment , social policy , internal security , increasing democracy , and the role of europe in the world are other issues dealt with in the document .
this does not , of course , guarantee that the work carried out during the conference will automatically be successful .
such an outcome can only be achieved through the efforts of the negotiators and the institutions to secure both a compromise and a quality result .
it is also worth noting that the european council has highlighted the enlargement issue - a challenge which europe must face up to in the future .
we need to outline a europe-wide scheme for peace and cooperation for the twenty-first century .
the number of debates that have taken place before as well as in the wake of the european council in turin , on topics covered by the conference and on europe in general , is impressive .
this seems to me to augur well for europe in the future , since it needs to elicit the attention and interest of its citizens .
however , an ' open ' conference , such as i have just described , does not take responsibility away from either the governments or parliaments of member states .
this ultimately remains with them .
the commission intends to carry out its role with this in mind .
it is the very model we are offering those countries whose aim is accession to the union .
however , to keep it intact , we need to introduce the far-reaching reforms set out in the opinion put forward by the commission on 28 february .
the citizens of the member states must feel like citizens of the union too , since this extends the rights of citizenship which they already possess in their own countries , whilst maintaining respect for fundamental rights .
if europe does not concern itself with the plight of its 18 million unemployed , then it has no meaning .
the union must project a strong image - a guarantee of peace and stability - particularly throughout our own continent .
the institutions will have to be adapted to deal with the union 's new dimensions and responsibilities .
the principle of unanimity causes paralysis , particularly as regards enlargement .
flexibility must therefore be considered and parliament 's role strengthened if we wish to establish a firm democratic reference point .
we cannot offer applicant countries membership of a union that is neither sufficiently prepared nor democratic enough to welcome them .
it concerned my proposal to introduce a european pact on employment , which i had the opportunity of putting forward in turin .
the heads of state and government reaffirmed their commitment to job creation and agreed to attach the utmost importance to this issue at the council meeting in florence .
the italian presidency also intends to convene a tripartite conference on growth and employment in rome in mid-june for governments , the social partners and the commission .
my aim is to encourage actions to combat unemployment .
it is clear that most of these measures need to be carried out at national level .
i do not wish to impose my own ideas , but rather encourage a dialogue between governments and social partners , in order to boost confidence .
there is no need to come up with radical new solutions : the basic ideas can be found in the commission 's white paper , approved in 1993 , on growth , competitiveness and employment .
what we are lacking is a coherent policy on employment through which to implement its proposals .
governments and the social partners have a special responsibility to combat unemployment .
our european pact on employment will make progress because we cannot do without it . the solidarity it will inspire will provide the dynamism that europe needs to make full use of its employment potential .
the socialist group shares that view .
i would add personally that in the last few months italy 's role as a proeuropean country committed to building the european union , a role which had seemed to be missing or even lost , has been reconstructed .
the socialist group also appreciates the work that has been done on citizenship , justice and home affairs .
of course there are unresolved problems , ignored by the council or inadequately dealt with , and they are set out one by one in the joint resolution .
so , while we appreciate the need for the reinforced cooperation clause , it is not clear whether and how it also guarantees the necessary institutional unity .
it will be the task of the conference to resolve this , of course .
we hope that these negotiations will be completed in amsterdam under the dutch presidency by the end of june 1997 .
seldom , mr president-in-office of the council , has a tableau been drawn up so full of fundamental questions and challenges facing the european union .
seldom too in the history of european unification was the risk so great that we would lose control of the political goal to which our generation owes decades of peace and prosperity .
that is the reason for our political responsibility in the months ahead .
we have inherited the fifty years which is now drawing to a close from the forwardlooking political courage of the statesmen who planned and built up the community of peace and progress .
the question we must answer is the following : what do we want to leave to the coming generation ?
what kind of europe are we going to hand on to the younger generation ?
what kind of message of hope can we transmit to the young people who all too often in our countries are deprived of the right to work and develop ?
our people are frightened when they think of the future .
we do not underestimate the difficulties of the negotiations .
that would be the worst possible hypothesis , for that would mean a postponement of all the basic problems .
in this respect i would remind you of a famous declaration and confirm that our group will never be satisfied with the european convoy only sailing at the speed of the slowest ships .
the epp group can accept the way in which the european parliament will be involved in the igc .
a public debate was wanted .
this time a new treaty will not only be negotiated by ministers , technocrats and diplomats , but the voice of the people in europe will be heard through those whom they democratically elected .
one issue dealt with in turin stands out , although it is still clouded by the more pressing problem of mad cow disease , and that is the issue of employment .
it will be up to those involved in the intergovernmental conference to make good that shortcoming .
and that is a great responsibility , since the future of europe is at stake .
improving the effectiveness of decision-making in the council , maintaining the authority of the commission and simplifying parliamentary procedures are essential reforms as the union is now .
but the prospect of enlargement - which must be accepted , since europe 's goal is that of opening its doors - makes these changes unavoidable .
marking the existence of such an ambition at the outset will be a sign of hope that is expected by the great majority of europe 's citizens .
mr president , i want to thank the president-inoffice for being here just a few days before voting takes place in italy , an event so important that it involves all the political and social forces of our country .
moreover we feel there is insufficient commitment to dealing with the most serious problem in every european country , the problem of employment .
i think a different commitment is needed , one that involves all the social partners , and first and foremost the trade unions of the european countries .
presidents h&auml;nsch , santer and dini , ladies and gentlemen , one particular image of the turin summit sticks in my mind .
the project to revise the treaty , of course , had a spanner in its works from the very beginning , and in our view the turin council summit has done nothing to alter that .
the cosmetic involvement of the european parliament that was decided upon is miles away from what we ourselves were demanding , namely a role in the ratification process .
public participation and debate in the widest possible sense are the only ways to overcome the clandestine nature of the intergovernmental conference and to let public acceptance gain ground over euroscepticism .
the fact is , of course , that the european union pursues an unfathomable policy , its words speaking of transparency but its actions of secrecy .
so we can scarcely wonder at people being every bit as distant from the eu as the eu is from democracy .
the tide did not turn at turin , and that is certainly not the fault of the presidency , which tried very hard .
klaus h&auml;nsch asked the council not to let its meetings degenerate into declaratory summits , but now , when i compare the statements with what is actually happening , mr h&auml;nsch 's call remains a pious wish .
so what are the candidate countries to think of the outcome , of the fact that foremost importance attaches to economic harmonization , when they played no part whatsoever in the conference ?
that is something they ought to tell us .
where , then , are the guidelines for improving the environmental situation ?
what are we to think of the decisions on mad cow disease ?
when was there a better time than now to make the switch towards species-related husbandry , natural feeding and controllable markets and away from the agroindustrial mentality ?
mr president , despite all the speeches and promises , the maastricht treaty appears increasingly to be the biggest stumbling-block to economic recovery and the fight against unemployment .
the figures are disastrous .
in europe , the average rate of unemployment rose from 9.6 % to 11 % between 1990 and 1995 .
six million jobs have been lost and 55 million people are living on the poverty line .
while fanatical supporters of european integration have for years been doing their utmost to advance the process of building europe , or so they claim , industrial production has stagnated and social breakdown has become worse .
while some of their leaders engage in trivial pursuits , the french people are growing increasingly concerned about relinquishing national sovereignty , and how this will affect their daily lives .
in this respect , the idea put about in some quarters of increased cooperation between some member states , with others constructively abstaining - what a joke !
- can only be a prelude to further withdrawals .
this puts us in mind of the fourth republic , and what is known as the policy of letting sleeping dogs lie .
a new referendum is now in order , in view of the insidious implementation of a federalist treaty that only just secured enough votes in 1992 .
the proposed changes arising out of the intergovernmental conference should provide a good reason for again asking the french people whether they are willing to entrust the most important aspects of french economic policy to supranational bodies .
life shows that any living creature that gives up the struggle is condemned to extinction !
parliament 's lack of interest in your appearance , demonstrated by this empty chamber , is a response to the lack of interest you have demonstrated towards us .
the president of the italian parliament , mr pivetti , came here to testify to the interest italian members of parliament take in their european colleagues .
you never came , and you represent the italian presidency .
but you come today , four days away from the italian election .
perhaps your presence today is not even a belated apology to all of us who have been elected , but another attempt to use the european platform for base domestic motives .
but you should know you have done your country a disservice .
decent men are capable of a little humility .
shrewd politicians know that the form is often the substance and in terms of form you have been extremely rude to this parliament .
this state of stagnation stands in the way of the creation of new wealth .
you are silent about relocation , about fundamentalism , about the deaths caused by failure to achieve political union .
as regards the verona summit , i merely point out that the economic disorder which prevents italy from enjoying the necessary credibility is the responsibility of many of your current electoral partners .
welcome
the visiting delegation is led by the president of the thai national assembly and includes parliamentarians from indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore and vietnam .
on behalf of our entire house , may i bid you a warm welcome to the european parliament and wish you every success in the work you are about to begin .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen of the aipo , welcome to the european parliament !
( loud applause )
european council in turin ( continuation )
mr president , i have listened with great interest to the views expressed this morning by honourable members of the european parliament .
europe has been an area of progress and prosperity in the past and we intend to make it so in the future .
i do not agree that the turin document is vague .
there will , i believe , be another opportunity for the italian president-inoffice of the council to come and report on the outcome of the june european council before the end of the italian presidency .
already , however , as the igc , you have made the first historic mistake .
you have excluded us from your work .
take note that this will stand in your way .
our parliament 's voice has been devalued .
i was surprised to learn that our two representatives , who will be silent recipients of regular information from you , had gone as far as actually to thank you for your relative willingness to provide it .
you should know , however , that parliament does not thank you , but blames you most severely for its exclusion .
unfortunately , however , your conference does not seem to have the power to make history .
some do not wish to , and others do not dare .
no strengthening of the union 's bodies , nor any deepening of cohesion .
it is indeed unbelievable that you proclaimed the protection of our frontiers in a limited way and no more than that , and so did a disservice to the peoples who bear the brunt of safeguarding europe 's frontiers .
on the subject of a more multi-speed europe too , we have not heard positive messages .
our aim should be to make the differences between the strong and the weak less pronounced , not to give those differences official expression and establish them institutionally .
i am still not sure that in the hands of this igc the ideal of a united europe will gain ground .
europe 's credibility is in your hands .
do not sacrifice it on the altar of any minor political expedients , whatever those may be .
it would be a pity for history one day to pronounce that your hands were shown to be lacking in strength and not entirely up to the opportunities this historic time offers .
will europe happen ?
mr martens for the ppe and other group presidents , setting aside some provincial propaganda which was exclusively for domestic use , have given the italian presidency credit for ensuring that the igc has made a good start .
mr president , i yield to the temptation to borrow a phrase from sir christopher wren on this occasion : ' si monumentum requieres , circumspice ' .
there was nothing to report , sadly .
in fact it would have been long-forgotten but for the fact that the major item for discussion was the bse disease and that the conference itself was held in the ferrari buildings .
the european union and its member states have a number of very major political , social and economic problems to confront over the next few years .
at the same time existing member states will have to prepare the way for the accession of up to 10 or even 15 new member states from central and eastern europe .
the likely accession of these countries will provide all europe with a unique opportunity to work together for a peaceful and secure future .
a straightforward redistribution of the existing resources from the structural funds and the common agricultural policy will result in the union 's agricultural regions taking on a disproportionately large share of the cost of enlargement .
the budget will have to be increased significantly if the existing common policies are to continue to operate effectively in an enlarged union .
after the igc conference there will be a wide-ranging public debate in each of the 15 eu countries and in some cases a referendum before the ratification process can be completed .
finally , during the course of these debates our citizens will be expecting clear evidence that the european union is capable of providing clear-cut and effective solutions to these major political , social and economic problems .
but a positive note has been struck , nevertheless .
we do note , however , certain omissions which are a cause for concern , but i would like to begin with the points which we feel are more positive .
it is recognised that the fight against unemployment must be our main priority - this calls for an economic policy which is orientated towards stability , greater competitiveness and far swifter growth .
as far as free circulation is concerned , there is an intention to implement coherent and effective policies in terms of asylum , emigration and visas , as well as stepping up controls at external borders .
the omissions which concern us start , for example , with the failure to make any reference to economic and social cohesion .
we are certain that the 15 heads of state and government will not call into question this principle because it is vital to european construction and must underlie all of its policies .
but it would be useful and reassuring if the principle could have been reiterated in the final communiqu&eacute; , something which did not happen .
the same concern is also valid for the problem of statutory equalities .
it is vital to ensure that demographic differences cannot have repercussions on the exercise of the presidency of the council of ministers , the representativeness of the commission or the equal status of all commissioners .
what is firmly fixed , following the meeting in the wellguarded factory area in turin , is some clear outline of what we can expect .
it is a clear procedure that has been adopted , and the outlines of the future union are more or less clear .
it concerns areas which are of decisive importance for the development of the european union .
i believe that we will do so again , and if the danish tradition is applied to the whole union , then the union project will encounter difficulties .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr dini has just told us that the heads of government were particularly concerned about employment .
that is good news , and i think parliament can take some credit for making it understood that our citizens are deeply anxious about this problem .
mr dini also said that employment policy was above all the prerogative of the member states .
no doubt that is true , but there are three points which i should like to make .
firstly , parliament believes that employment should be one of our guiding principles as we move towards economic and monetary union .
in introducing a single currency , we must have a goal , and this should naturally be employment .
secondly , i believe that if the procedures approved in essen are to bear fruit , they must be improved .
in our view , it would help to make employment a truly european issue - and this is essential - if a chapter on employment were to be inserted in the treaty .
thirdly , there can be no employment policy without a social policy .
this concept needs to be reiterated .
but i should also like to mention the status of the european parliament , and to acknowledge the considerable effort which the council and the italian presidency have made in order to reach a solution .
i think the outcome is a purely symbolic one , but it should not be ignored .
the opposition of the french and british governments seriously affects us all . we must overcome france 's over-sensitivity about national sovereignty and the british government 's refusal to accept both europe and democracy .
but in its resolution last december , parliament also referred to the interinstitutional conference .
it seems to me that relations between parliament and the intergovernmental conference are more conflictual than amicable .
from an institutional point of view , this arrangement maintains a balance of power that is fairer to parliament .
mr president , i trust that you will once again put the interinstitutional conference on the agenda , in accordance with the wishes of the house .
and that is why the socialist group will be voting in favour of the amendment which the green group has tabled on this issue .
mr president , in his introductory remarks prime minister dini stressed how very important it is to fight unemployment .
i fully share this point of view .
however , the fight against unemployment cannot comprise merely fine words , not even if a separate title in the treaty is devoted to the subject .
the swedish proposal for an employment union is an example of this .
originally , this proposal was a proposal to coordinate finance policies and make them more expansionary and to increase demand in times of economic recession .
it was a proposal which really could have had an effect at european level in checking the recession .
now the proposal has been abandoned totally .
it was not taken further because it conflicts with monetary union and the policy of convergence .
this is thus another example of the fact that today the policy of convergence is the biggest single stumbling block in the fight against unemployment in western europe .
this policy must therefore be reviewed , as must the emu project .
if unemployment could be ' talked out of existence ' we would have got rid of it here a long time ago - but that is not possible .
i have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
preparation of ccee for accession
madam president , the white paper on adapting to the internal market , which is the basis for our opinion , provides an excellent indicator for membership of the union .
it does not contain data on accession , for that is up to the acceding countries themselves .
the speed at which they move towards accession and the ground they have to cover will dictate the time at which they can accede to the union .
of course what will happen is that in order to treat everyone at the same level we will have to choose a starting point which is at least symbolically and politically the same one .
for example it could be the commission offering advice on the various applicant countries , or it could be a symbolic starting time for the beginning of the process .
the path indicated can be travelled voluntarily , nothing is being forced .
we are not even forcing ourselves to do anything .
the white paper is not a recruiting instrument to enlist newcomers .
often applicant countries are well on the right tracks .
sometimes , however , they have a lot of ground to cover .
in this house we have debated the actions of the prime minister of slovakia who is making life extremely difficult for the president of the republic and we fear that things are not well in that sphere .
the rule of law and democracy and the creation of a responsible , well organised society is very much in the interests of the union and the applicant countries .
by emphasising this we are showing our clear support for democratic processes and forces in the applicant countries .
we want to be an alliance of countries based on the rule of law , with a proper community character , and not just a club of rich countries .
and so i think that we in this house should take a look at the community spirit of applicant countries .
for that could be a very good reason for saying yes or no when it comes to our vote , and we do , after all , have the last word .
the igc will have to prove that the present member states take enlargement seriously .
a strengthened union must at least make it possible for new countries to join .
at the end of their journey they should find a house and not a shack awaiting them .
europe will then remain impotent and be forced to call in the americans to help solve the slightest conflict .
the report emphasises the need for mutual cooperation between the relevant applicant countries .
it is good that we are getting away from channelling everything through brussels .
formerly they had to channel everything through moscow .
they will have to get used to working together , to trading with each other and to developing together , just as we had to in the union .
that is also true for cooperation with countries outside the scope of accession .
i am thinking in particular of ukraine , belarus , the russian federation , moldova .
we are not forgetting them and stress that trans-border projects with them are also a very important factor in optimising mutual relations .
the report also emphasises the social aspects because a situation of major changes can also lead to significant social harm in the applicant countries and so even undermine confidence in the forthcoming accession .
we also insist that due attention be paid to the environment .
important aspects are taken up by the many draftsmen of an opinion .
together with industry a code will have to be worked out for our own ailing industry so that we genuinely contribute to a healthy and sustainable development .
the report contains many sections because there were so many draftsmen of opinions .
it also calls for proper information to be provided for the public in the central and eastern european countries .
they must discover what european integration is all about .
strangely enough even some of the politicians there have little idea of it .
people in the applicant countries , just like our own citizens in the union , must clearly understand that we are serious about ensuring that no major mistakes are made and that the surveillance and antifraud procedures are operating .
the debate on security policy is also echoed in this report , particularly in the section on eu security guarantees or indirectly via the weu and the possibly imperfect overlap of our membership with nato .
the enlargement of the european union is a challenge for the decades ahead .
we now have the opportunity with the applicant countries to do something that for all too long was unthinkable .
enlargement will take time .
it is not possible , as one of the amendments says , that every time we take a decision we must wait until we have a complete insight into all the financial repercussions of the accession .
it will be a very long time before we have a complete picture and we must not do anything to depart from the strong stance we have taken in favour of enlargement .
there is a whiff of isolationism in the air even in europe .
but to entrench ourselves smugly in a fortress europe would be the worst thing we could possibly do .
the applicant countries are carefully watching our reactions and this debate must send out the right signal to them .
that is why i would strongly oppose any manoeuvre to postpone or set up financial barriers , for example , or undermine our determination to work confidently towards enlargement .
madam president , the white paper on the preparation of the associated countries for membership of the internal market of the european union only deals with agricultural aspects in a small way .
it deals with guidance for the associated countries relating to some agricultural sectors and connected with veterinary checks , the free movement of goods , phytosanitary products and fodder , and the requirements for marketing certain products .
to this end the oostlander report takes substantial note of the european commission guidelines which are very clear , very precise and do not leave room for subjective interpretation .
the problem for agriculture is a problem of outlook .
i believe , in agreement with the oostlander report , that it is not possible to say we will do the accounts first and then see what implications the enlargement will have .
instead it is a matter of working right away for the enlargement and adapting the common agricultural policy to the guidelines that the commission adopted at the madrid summit .
in my opinion this constitutes a good starting point for ensuring that the whole of european agriculture spends less on traditional support to markets and more on structural policy and rural development .
madam president , the economic affairs committee is in favour of enlargement but disagrees with the oostlander report on its timing .
an overhasty accession , in other words before the applicant countries and the union itself are ready , is not in the interests of either the applicants or the union .
first of all the union must through the igc re-assert its authority to take decisions and become more democratic .
now that there are no more border controls there is no longer any scope for a special status on the internal market .
accession might well take a long time , certainly into the next century .
but in the meantime the applicant countries should not be expected to travel that path empty-handed .
the present trade regulations with central and eastern europe are hypocritical .
the most difficult and restricted access to the union is reserved for the most competitive products .
it is no wonder that the european union has built up a trade surplus .
that must change quickly if the union wants to remain credible .
madam president , to deal with energy in the countries of eastern europe in just one minute would almost be a record !
but i am going to try and be extremely brief , if not terse , and say simply that the recommendation contained in the oostlander report touches on two main points .
firstly , we must take into account that the countries of central and eastern europe are heavily dependent on nuclear power .
and , on the other , to envisage a realistic timescale for the possible closure of nuclear power stations that do not comply with basic safety regulations .
the second point in the recommendation is that we must investigate all the different energy sources which might be available in central and eastern europe .
i personally had suggested that the commission should organize a regional energy conference in these countries , with a view to encouraging diversification .
madam president , we are aware that the integrationrelated problems of the countries of central and eastern europe are great , and that the starting-point of each country is different .
given that their social structures are diverse , we must look for convergence in terms of increased democracy , the rule of law and responsible administration .
i shall now try to summarize the three areas on which the committee on external economic relations wishes to place particular emphasis .
firstly , the transposition of the community 's laws into the national legislation of each of the countries concerned , with particular attention being given to social and environmental requirements , will involve a huge legislative effort .
similarly , a revision of the common agricultural policy must prevent increased rural desertification and serve to maintain the standard of living of the union 's farmers .
madam president , the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights welcomes the white paper .
a proposal has been made to strengthen the legal system by creating an administrative , organizational and legal infrastructure .
it will not be enough merely to inform the candidate countries of current community legislation .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin my remarks with three basic observations .
first of all , the gradual eastward enlargement of the european union is a task of historical necessity .
secondly , many countries of central and eastern europe are plagued by indescribable poverty and social deprivation .
thirdly , many member states of the union are also faced with serious social problems .
these observations form the basis of my opinion .
the fundamental requirement is the incorporation into the integration process of the social dimension as reflected in the european social model .
unfortunately , too little account is taken of this requirement in mr oostlander 's report .
this phased plan must include the social dimension .
the union must assist the candidates for accession to establish and develop socially orientated administrative and organizational infrastructures .
this socially acceptable form of integration will entail extremely high costs both for the union and for the acceding countries .
that is why the union has to adopt the appropriate measures in good time .
the necessary integration of the countries of central and eastern europe must be managed judiciously and in a socially responsible manner .
otherwise the unwanted social side-effects of such integration could jeopardize the gratifying democratic developments in the applicant countries and their commitment to the idea of a common european home .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the accession of the countries of central and eastern europe will bring about some very profound changes , not least to the regional policy of the european union .
we shall have to talk about who will then belong to the so-called objective 1 regions . we shall have to talk about who is to benefit from the cohesion funds and so forth .
economic and social cohesion will , of course , remain our aim . on that we are agreed .
but i feel we have not given enough thought to the level at which this economic and social cohesion is supposed to materialize .
we should remain realistic , and it is essential that we discuss this question of levels .
at the present time , regional policy rather tends to play a minor role in the european commission .
finally , let me make a comment that applies not only to regional policy but also to our entire approach to the countries of central and eastern europe . we always speak of these countries as a single bloc .
some even call them the ccees or peco . but in reality they are individual states .
they are civilized nations , each with as rich a history as the countries of western europe . i ask you to keep calling that to mind .
the integration of these states means far more than restructuring national economic systems to adapt them to new legal norms and regulations .
although in its white paper the commission only deals with the economic aspects of accession , it is quite clear that this can only be one part of the accession process .
the european parliament and the oostlander report have made this point very clearly .
our unequivocal position is that although economic adjustment is immensely important , the other areas - culture , education and the audiovisual media - should also receive the full attention of the governments of these countries .
the committee on culture , youth , education and the media , on whose behalf i speak here , takes the view that culture has to be seen as a separate issue .
the cultural heritage of europe must not be considered within the confines of the union alone .
in the domain of education , the committee warns everyone concerned to avoid putting immediate political gains - such as securing industrial jobs in the short term - before the long-term goal of high-quality basic and advanced training .
such strategies would lead in the medium term to stagnation and decline .
if culture and education are ignored , enlargement will become a mechanical process that can only lead to disillusionment and inefficiency in the long run , and that is certainly not in our interests !
madam president , it is the historic task of our generation to make europe whole , to remove the vestiges of 50 years of ideological dictatorship and repression in central and eastern europe .
yet peace and security also means freedom for crime and terrorism .
crime has spread in the vacuum left by the dictatorship .
criminals get through traditional border controls because their organizations have become far more international than the police .
we shall require the new member states to take action against mafia activity , drug-related crime , trafficking in human beings , illegal immigration , etc. and we shall make demands of ourselves .
in our own countries we have allowed crime to overwhelm us .
we continually deploy too much manpower at borders , where citizens ' passports and luggage are carefully checked .
it is to no avail and , furthermore , we cooperate far too little to make common cause against international crime .
this is a key issue in regard to enlargement , because if we are to sustain the public 's confidence in enlargement , then it must not be seen to be associated with rising crime .
madam president , real socialism leaves behind a catastrophic environmental legacy .
the alarming environmental situation is a real danger to public health .
the available know-how must be deployed to ensure that the quality of water , air and soil undergoes constant systematic improvement , not only in western europe but in the east too .
safety standards at nuclear plants , as well as the safeguards in place at the numerous storage sites for radioactive waste , are of the utmost importance to the entire global population .
the technical capability of the waste-disposal plants available in individual countries to recycle hazardous waste safely could be used as a criterion in decisions on waste management .
minimum environmental protection standards should be defined , and states should receive financial and advisory assistance to make those standards attainable .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the committee on institutional affairs regards enlargement as both a political necessity and a historic opportunity for europe .
however , we have stressed the fact that if the european plan is to be viable , the new treaty must first of all provide for institutional instruments that meet the requirements of an enlarged union .
because if institutional reform does not go far enough , it will endanger the very process of building europe .
we must avoid the risk of europe being watered down .
broadening and deepening must be reconciled , through in-depth strengthening and reform of the present institutional framework .
increased democracy , efficiency , solidarity and transparency must be the key elements in that reform process .
whether or not the union is ready for enlargement will depend on the outcome of the igc .
in this context , the committee on institutional affairs would like to lay down a condition which it believes is unavoidable , namely that the house should deliver a favourable opinion at the end of the negotiations .
fisheries , as it happens , vary greatly in their importance to the economies of the individual candidate countries .
nevertheless , there are common features , which demand a uniform approach by the european union .
the impact of integration on the applicant countries will be considerable .
our accession strategy must take due account of this fact .
the development of new economic structures and an integration process without traumatic consequences must be our stated objectives .
the present report by mr oostlander has been long awaited , not only by us .
these countries are looking hopefully towards a future in the european union .
in this report we are giving a political signal , telling them that we await them in the strasbourg family .
but until then there is much to be done by all sides .
i thank mr oostlander , who devoted particular attention to the situation of women in central and eastern europe and adopted the main points from the opinion delivered by the committee on women 's rights .
these women need to know what they can expect from membership of the european union .
they also have to be sure that joint efforts will be undertaken to promote employment and education as well as social and health services for women and girls .
efforts must be made from the very outset to ensure that women are not economically and socially marginalized .
in eastern and central europe many women are trained for technical occupations and are to be found in far greater numbers in the realms of science and research than is the case in western europe , for example .
let us ensure that they can assume an increasing amount of political responsibility and can thus effectively play an active part in helping to shape life in the european union .
let us support the young democracies by means of reliable partnership and clear messages .
madam president , i shall restrict myself to two points after congratulating mr oostlander on his fine , factual , in-depth report .
the two points i want to make are as follows .
first of all everyone will agree that it is extremely important that we increasingly adopt a pan-european approach to transport .
we see the trouble in our part of europe caused by not managing to set up a proper transport policy in the european union .
there we hope , together with the relevant authorities from the eastern european countries , to shape the pan-european transport policy .
the second point i wish to highlight is the area of tension on the requirements necessary for vehicles from eastern european countries operating on our markets .
we all know how important it is to reduce the environmental pollution from traffic .
we lay down stringent requirements on vehicles stationed in western europe .
we now see an increasing number of vehicles from eastern europe which do not come anywhere near meeting these same requirements operating on our road network .
i would appreciate hearing what the commissioner has to say on this area of tension .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , back in the summer of 1993 the european council decided that those countries of central and eastern europe which wanted to join the european union could do so .
the european council set out the conditions , and quite tough conditions they are too .
the obstacle to accession is not insurmountable , but it is very high .
president dini stated this morning that preparations for enlargement are also on the agenda of the intergovernmental conference .
he said that the agenda was ambitious and kaleidoscopic , that the council will present an interim report and that the madrid decisions are to be implemented .
those are clear words .
the european union provided help .
in short , the european union has made a decisive contribution .
but the really strenuous efforts to date have been made by the governments and more especially by the people in the countries of central and eastern europe themselves .
moreover , they have no influence over the essential reform measures that we still have to adopt within the community , for example in the domains of finance and agriculture .
the countries of central and eastern europe , however , are not deterred by this , nor should we in the european parliament be deterred by the magnitude of the tasks facing us .
we want to modernize the european union .
we want to guarantee stability in europe , both now and in the long term .
we know that this will not be free of charge , but the cost of non-accession , the cost of instability in europe and the cost of separate development would be far , far higher .
the future accession of the countries of central and eastern europe to the european union is no reason for euphoria and certainly not for arrogance .
the future enlargement of the european union gives us no cause for excessive optimism , but neither should it cause us undue alarm .
we must set about our task of creating the new europe of the twentieth century realistically , critically and confidently .
the forthcoming enlargement is part of that task .
our europe will become what we ourselves make of it .
i have spent considerable time in central europe since the revolutions and i believe that we owe our fellow-europeans the courtesy of the truth .
enlargement is not only necessary , it is urgent .
we can help that process by the raft of programmes we already have in place but , most notably , we can help by training their civil servants .
we can hinder that process by failing to put our own house in order over the common agricultural policy and over budget reform .
above all we can hinder that process by a failure of imagination and by self-absorption .
the financial aspects of enlargement will not be clear for some time yet .
they will depend on the sequence and on the timing of that enlargement and on the progress of the cap reform .
this is no time for bean counting , it is a time for clarity of intent and honesty of purpose .
madam president , this debate has assumed a historical dimension , since it is a case of finally turning over one of the darkest pages in our european past .
the countries of central and eastern europe are european countries .
we all share the same values and heritage .
however , 50 years ago they were torn away from europe and forced into a geopolitical entity where they have never felt at home .
for these countries , the european union has always been an ideal , because in their eyes , it represents a success in three areas : democracy , security and prosperity .
furthermore , the european union has grown larger and more complex and cannot admit new countries without taking substantial precautions to ensure that its cohesion is not weakened .
but if we speed up the process , we run a serious risk of causing them to miss their opportunity .
that is why it is important for us to do our best to prepare them for accession .
there are three conditions to be met .
first of all , these countries must share our aims and values .
they must accede in the hope of sharing not only in our prosperity , but in everything that gives meaning to europe , above all democracy .
cooperation on a regional level will accustom them to this .
finally , it is understandable that having had their independence suppressed for 50 years , national security is of great concern to these countries .
as things are at present , nato represents , in their eyes , the kind of security structure that meets their needs .
countries which have emerged from the communist bloc must be able to choose freely the type of security structures they wish to have .
to appease russia , not by giving in to its demands , but through an exhaustive dialogue , is a crucial element in the process of enlargement .
mr oostlander 's report sets out very clearly the information on preparing for enlargement , and for this reason , my group will give it its support .
in this resolution parliament rallies behind the view of the commission and the council .
the commission must present its opinions on all the applicant countries soon after the igc negotiations .
the applicant countries should be treated on an equal footing and the complete acceptance of the ' acquis communautaire ' should be central to the negotiations .
the commission 's white paper is a very useful tool in this exercise .
the preparations in the individual countries will determine the time of accession .
the consensus between the institutions on the procedure to be followed will enable an accession which has been well prepared .
of course it will cost money , and if you are thinking of costs then i am sure that it will cost more the longer we fail to implement what we have decided .
i could not agree more with mr spencer .
there is a lot to be done in economic terms for the central and eastern european countries .
with a little help from the european union they will be able to make it .
for this adaptation process they have no need of tons of white papers but concrete aid .
once the adaptation process has been completed they will be ready to accede .
madam president , like the rapporteur , we are in principle in favour of enlargement to include the countries of central and eastern europe , since we believe that a united europe is inconceivable without their participation .
nevertheless , widening must be accompanied by deepening - in order to prevent the european union from becoming a mere free-trade area - and progress towards political union , with the introduction of the essential institutional reforms .
if there is something which we must export to those countries , it is not all-out economic liberalism , but the european social model .
consequently , there is a need to ensure the preservation of policies such as the cap - albeit reformed - and the structural funds .
we do not wish to see agricultural policies returned to national control , or appropriations for the structural funds remaining unaltered , with the same amount of money being distributed between a greater number of countries .
in the political field , we must support the deepening of democracy and the defence of human rights .
and as regards security , accession to the european union must not be automatically linked to accession to nato .
that is not the way to guarantee the security of the countries of central and eastern europe .
the way to do that is to create a genuine european security and defence identity , based on new foundations and adapted to the current situation .
we are therefore in favour of enlargement .
this report represents a contribution - albeit an inadequate one - to that process .
we in the green group see eastward enlargement as the current political goal of the european union .
enormous historical importance attaches to it .
it could become one of the main prerequisites of a peaceful and democratic europe .
the countries of eastern europe in particular entertain high hopes of early accession .
after all , it is not only the countries of central and eastern europe that have to prepare to move in step with the european union .
it would be wrong to try and solve the european union 's own structural problems by extending its market eastwards .
how are these countries to develop the ecological and social aspects of their economies if the so-called conditions of accession are based on an export-orientated development process ?
this would resolve neither the social nor the democratic conflicts in those countries .
expecting the countries of central and eastern europe to embrace the principles of the common agricultural policy is a step in the wrong direction .
if they pursue such a policy , they will be faced with a huge employment crisis .
those countries are neither prepared for such a crisis nor able to overcome it .
the european union has no option but to prepare for this enlargement by reforming its structural and agricultural policies .
i also believe it is wrong to seek to develop a common security policy without preventive mechanisms and without the osce .
this is a major flaw in the oostlander report .
madam president , the white paper on which this report is based deals with a vast but well-defined subject : preparing the associated countries of central and eastern europe for integration into the union 's internal market .
mr oostlander , whom i congratulate on the quality of his work , has decided to extend the scope of his report .
he has presented us with an overall political picture of enlargement , the reasons behind it , its effects , and the conditions which have to be fulfilled in order for enlargement to be successful .
the 15 opinions of the specialist committees have enabled us to cover a wide spectrum of issues .
in general , i am in favour of mr oostlander 's report .
it is constructive , positive and does not discriminate between the associated countries of central and eastern europe , all of whom are starting out from the same point .
however , it could perhaps have placed more emphasis on the considerable opportunity which enlargement represents for ourselves .
but i would earnestly ask that mentioning pre-conditions should not make people think that we are , in fact , in no hurry to throw our doors open to new residents .
only then will they be able to summon up the energy needed to justify the tremendous effort that is and will continue to be required from their people .
just think of the progress already made : for example , a 7 % annual increase in gnp in both poland and the czech republic .
political action thrives on goals , hope , and even dreams .
for those of a more serious or technical turn of mind , there is the white paper itself .
the commission has carried out an excellent piece of work , which is already proving useful in planning the reforms that are being carried out in the countries of central and eastern europe .
i was in poland recently and can confirm this .
naturally , this white paper on the internal market will be supplemented by others .
this subsequent work will allow progress to be assessed , but above all it will encourage the efforts made by the applicant countries , as well as ourselves .
nobody puts a question mark against the white paper 's and the report 's principal political objective : peace and stability in europe .
but the question is whether the means to achieve this are the right ones .
the keyword is adaptation , which actually means , in practice , submission .
there are political conditions attached to our neighbours ' access to our markets , and these political conditions are based on the obsessive notion that social , political and legal problems are solved by means of strengthened supranational mechanisms .
it is a tragic mistake , not made any better by the report 's highflown language which includes an innovation called the social market economy .
i will admit that social market economy is linguistically creative , but unfortunately politically impossible .
madam president , in the report on the accession of the countries of central and eastern europe to the european union , i was particularly struck by the constant references to democracy and human rights .
i was also struck by the report 's obsession with economics , when what europe needs is political will .
it is up to us , in company with our comrades in the east , to seek a third way , one far removed from socialism as well as capitalism , both of which generate poverty and social injustice .
madam president , we should not lose sight of what the oostlander report is all about : it is a response to the commission 's white paper and it is not parliament 's definitive decision on enlargement .
we should make that clear to everyone .
the committee on budgets did not submit any amendments to the report for the simple reason that we are awaiting the outcome of a public hearing next month on the cost of enlargement .
we would have much preferred that the oostlander report waited until after that hearing or , indeed , that the hearing be brought forward .
i think that is to some extent a condemnation of the timetabling of parliament 's business .
but here we are , we are left with the report , and the fact that the budgets committee has not yet had its hearing .
i do not take exception to what tom spencer said : i take it as a compliment when i am criticized in this respect .
but tom said something about the budgets committee wanting to spoil this report because it is involved in bean counting .
one of the questions we have to ask , quite frankly , is how many beans are the member states prepared to pay for enlargement ?
until we get an answer to that , we can pontificate as much as we want about enlargement and will be giving a false impression until we know the cost .
parliament 's position on enlargement deserves something far better than a report of this kind .
at least it deserves a committee in its own right , as we had with east german accession .
we should not be giving those applicant countries false hope until we know the cost .
madam president , the council has decided that the european union is to be enlarged to include the states of central and eastern europe , and the european parliament supports that decision .
it represents both a historic challenge and an opportunity for all concerned .
for the first time , the states within the boundaries of europe can become a community devoted to peace .
the closer we come to this step , however , the more discussion there will be of the details of enlargement .
the white paper is a compendium of rules governing the working of the european internal market , and in the event of accession the candidates will also have to base their policies on the white paper .
so that proper preparation can take place and excessive expectations and misleading arguments can be avoided , this subject must be systematically and seriously discussed in all its aspects .
it is clear , and has often been said , that while the european union has to move , so too must the candidate states .
this report by mr oostlander can only be the starting-point for a thorough discussion .
as a budget expert , i should like to add that the committee on budgets , as barry wynn pointed out , will contribute to a wide-ranging discussion of this matter .
on 7 may the committee will stage a hearing on the financial aspects of enlarging the european union , which will culminate in the use of its right of initiative to table a report .
both the oostlander report and the christodoulou report on the financial aspects of enlargement are intended as a signal to the council to institute concrete measures at the igc and thereafter with regard to the forthcoming enlargement .
they are also meant to demonstrate that parliament has already begun its work towards this end and intends to pursue it resolutely .
madam president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his report which can at least be called comprehensive .
it tackles many aspects of enlargement of the union , including the budget , education , social affairs , the second and third pillars .
but in my view the commission 's white paper is not about that .
the white paper is about preparing the central and eastern european countries for their integration into the union 's internal market .
but our proposals are important for the integration of applicant countries into the union 's internal market .
among other things they include the tremendous legislative task facing the countries of central and eastern europe to adapt their national legislation to the internal market .
the central and eastern european countries must be encouraged and motivated into accepting the temporary high costs of this because this adaption is needed for the major paneuropean market of the future .
it goes without saying that we shall have to help them in this process .
the principles of competition must be respected in the central and eastern european countries and the criteria for granting public aid must be harmonised .
madam president , there is no doubt that enlargement is being promoted by the dominant powers in the european union , for ideological and geopolitical reasons .
i think today 's debate proves that the european parliament too subscribes to that kind of thinking .
how can our peoples pretend to adopt that policy when its consequences for their countries and for themselves are unknown ?
i do not think that anyone gives us the right to teach democracy to any of europe 's peoples .
democracy and social integration are the concerns of all peoples , and from that point of view i think we ought to act with reserve and be careful about how we approach the countries of eastern and central europe .
madam president , the enlargement of the european union towards the east is written in the stars , and is therefore as inevitable as it is inviolable .
this is a fact of life which no member state can deny .
nevertheless , the negotiations which will begin after the intergovernmental conference must concentrate on establishing the conditions that are required to make integration a politically constructive process .
however , according to present studies , it would not be in the interests of either the applicant countries or ourselves if accession were to take place before 2005 .
hungary , poland , the czech republic and slovenia have all made tremendous efforts in order to join the union .
we must not deceive them , and must therefore show , without resorting to either populism or paternalism , that we have the political will to include them among our number .
quite simply , opening up towards the east is the wind of change that many liberal governments are hoping will flatten for good the still fragile house of cards of genuine political and social union .
that is the challenge which is facing us .
i believe , and i shall focus my speech today on this , that in addition to the economic and political aspects security must also play a major part in the debate on enlargement .
so mr oostlander is quite right in his report to say that the enlargement of the union will require an adjustment of european security structures .
in the first place we shall have to study the place of future eu member states within the western european union and nato . as far as i am concerned these countries are welcome there in principle .
but nobody can deny that the enlargement of nato in particular will meet with strong resistance from the russian federation .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i too would like to commend mr oostlander on his excellent in-depth report .
however , i cannot conceal a slight feeling of dissatisfaction which it is beyond the power of mr oostlander alone to overcome .
this is a great pity , since our work needs such a perspective .
we are taking part in a historic adventure .
the 15 present member states of the union have practically all waged war on each other during the course of the last seven or eight centuries .
the arrival on the scene of other nations provides a chance for reconciliation in a continent that has experienced more wars than almost any other .
furthermore , history contains no case of a great power that has been forged other than by conquering its future vassal states .
i would also stress that the final choice of dates does not lie with the european parliament , but with the intergovernmental conference .
i do not think it would be wise to take any risks , however small , in this respect .
we ask you to heed our message , commissioner .
since we have listed figures , doubts , uncertainties , and conditions , we should also mention motives , which could turn out to be noble and generous .
we are embarking on the greatest political adventure that mankind has ever witnessed .
madam president , as a long-time student of the enlargement question , i must confess to being slightly bemused by the debate going on about this particular round of enlargement .
we started off a couple of years ago with everybody saying ' oh , we must enlarge ' , talking very glibly about it as if it was about members joining some sort of social club .
i found myself warning that it was not as simple as that .
but we have now got ourselves into a position where everybody is throwing up their arms in horror at the enormous difficulties , and that is before we have even started the negotiations .
i find myself having to play down those difficulties .
as the last speaker on behalf of parliament i ought to reiterate some basic points .
firstly , it is not a question of if we enlarge , it is a question of when we enlarge .
the european union is open to any state which meets the basic criteria .
in addition , to the central and eastern european countries we have long said that if they threw off the yoke of dictatorship we would welcome them into our family .
if we reverse that message now we run the risk of undermining all the reforms which have taken place at great pain in central and eastern europe .
we also run the risk of seeing a descent into the sort of ethnic tension we have been horrified by in yugoslavia .
we also run the risk , as mr wiersma has said , of undermining the security of the continent .
that said , of course , we have to acknowledge that there are major difficulties which need to be addressed in the years to come , particularly in agriculture and the regional fund and in the decision-making structure .
to underestimate those difficulties would be ultimately to undermine the enlargement process .
an overhasty enlargement would actually do more harm than good .
we cannot pretend that these problems do not exist .
we cannot constantly be operating under the tyranny of the committee on budgets in the european parliament .
i welcome the white paper because it is a start in addressing the practical issues in relation to enlargement .
at the end of the day enlargement is a political question , it is a question of political will by political leaders .
do we want to make it happen ?
there is also a question of political acceptability to the citizens of the european union and to the citizens of the central and eastern european countries .
unless they are prepared to accept the conditions we negotiate , it will not happen .
we should bear that in mind in everything we say and do leading up to ultimate enlargement in the next century .
madam president , i have listened with great interest and fascination this morning to the many members who have spoken on this highly important subject of the enlargement of the european union .
may i first of all congratulate the rapporteur , mr oostlander , on his comprehensive report and the great deal of work he has put into it .
i know that he consulted many other parliamentary committees in order to product a well balanced text and we ourselves had the pleasure of discussing the subject with him on several occasions .
it is a historic opportunity , a point which has been made several times this morning .
we ought to seize this opportunity , which is not easy at times , but the political decision taken at the european council in copenhagen in 1993 was clear .
the member states decided to further in this way the political , economic and social development of all peoples in europe .
in that decision security policy played a determining role .
a successful intergovernmental conference is in the view of the commission essential for enlargement .
we in the commission know that parliament agrees with us here .
mr oostlander 's report also makes this quite clear .
you will recall the promise given to you by the council during the last enlargement .
the european council in madrid in december proclaimed a new phase in the process of enlargement of the union and was challenged to define the procedure and the timetable for its preparation .
the commission was instructed to produce a report on certain aspects of enlargement . it has to further evaluate the consequences of enlargement on community policy , with particular reference to agriculture and structural policy .
the european council will resume its examination on the basis of these reports .
the commission services continue to analyze the consequences of enlargement on the union 's policy as well as the situation in each of the applicant countries .
these opinions will be accompanied by a so-called synthesis document in which the main horizontal questions relevant to the enlargement and the prospect of accession negotiations will be addressed .
the commission will then produce a statement on the financial framework , after 1999 , which takes account of the possible enlargement .
the council will then decide on the start of accession negotiations in the light of all these reports .
with regard to cyprus and malta , as you know , the decision was taken to start negotiations six months after the conclusion of the igc .
but definitive decisions have yet to be taken .
that is the situation at the moment and i intend , and the commission intends , to involve the european parliament as closely as possible in this process .
it is only by working in harmony with the other institutions that this ambitious task can be done .
we need your help and advice and this report from mr oostlander forms a good point of departure .
more specifically with regard to the implementation of the white paper considerable progress has been made with preparing the associated countries to integrate into the internal market .
they have worked out new national strategies to adapt to the legislation of the internal market or are in the process of doing so in close cooperation with the commission .
this service will soon be expanded to include experts in the field of the internal market from national administrations and from private bodies in the member states .
i shall now turn briefly to the specific paragraphs of the motion for a resolution .
we fully support the broad outlines of the motion for a resolution .
paragraph 1 calls the enlargement of the european union to include the countries of central and eastern europe a momentous opportunity to contribute to peace , security and prosperity throughout europe .
that is the commission 's starting point for its future activities .
in paragraph 4 the council and the member states at the igc are urged to do everything in their power to reform the institutions of the european union to enable the eu to operate more effectively .
as i have already said , the commission totally endorses that view .
in various paragraphs you call for more white papers to be presented on various subjects .
i would , however , point out that pursuant to the european council in madrid the commission has been instructed to present various reports .
in addition to the detailed opinions on the applications for accession the commission will also produce a synthesis document on the enlargement .
i have already mentioned that .
so the commission has already a large number of reports to work on .
secondly , the existence of a functioning market economy and thirdly the ability to withstand the pressure of competition and market forces within the union .
we believe that clearly describes the criteria .
this important debate will undoubtedly be followed by many more .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place in a moment .
votes
before this roll-call vote is held , i should simply like to point out that the amendment relates only to the figures .
rejecting it would therefore amount to contesting the figures , which at present are not in dispute .
after the vote on the amendments :
mr president , ladies and gentlemen .
what we therefore want is referral back to committee to have the strategic debate on it there because it has not been properly debated yet .
we believe it extremely important that parliament give itself time to examine whether the consequences of this decision will be what we want , namely budgetisation , so that we create a clear structural situation .
we are calling for more time for a strategic debate and hence for referral back to committee .
i thank those members who are applauding in advance what i am about to say .
i should like to say to mrs aelvoet that , despite the fact that we are on opposite sides of the house , i fully support her proposal for referral back to committee .
i do not agree with her when she calls for the european development fund to be integrated into the general budget , since that would mean that the acp countries would receive less money .
i do agree with her , however , when she says that the debate was not conducted properly and that we are sending a bad signal to the acp countries .
it is not the question of the integration of the edf into the budget or otherwise which determines our rejection of this report , but the fact that we are sending a bad signal to the acp countries .
to refuse the discharge would be to call into question our cooperation with those countries and our will to continue that cooperation .
it would be to exploit the issue of budgetizing the edf , through an institutional ploy which we reject , to the detriment of our relations with the acp countries .
i am therefore in favour of referring the report back to committee .
mr president , the proposal to refer this back to committee is totally inappropriate , particularly for the reasons given .
it was a perfectly proper debate .
i can think of no circumstances less appropriate to refer a matter back to the committee .
this house should reject this proposal .
( applause )
( parliament rejected the proposal to refer the matter back to committee )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , on a point of order , i should like to move an amendment to the order of voting .
in the voting list the amendment i am tabling on behalf of the group of the european people 's party comes before the amendment tabled by the green group in the european parliament .
the greens ' amendment , however , goes further .
both amendments concern research with foetal tissue .
the greens reject such research outright .
good reasons may be found for that , but it does not reflect the view expressed by parliament in other resolutions .
i believe we can then carry this amendment no 3 together , because parliament has already adopted it once .
but let me add that some groups would like a separate vote on the passage concerning somatic gene therapy at the end of amendment no 3 .
if it is still possible , i should like to ask for that to be arranged , but the more important point to me is the voting sequence .
mr liese , i cannot agree with you .
the order in which the secretariat has prepared the vote is the logical and correct order .
mr president , you certainly answered my point very clearly and assuredly .
i should just like to know what makes you so sure that a total ban on research in a particular field is less far-reaching than the subjection of such research to certain safety regulations .
at any rate , i stand by my opinion and call for the vote to be taken first on the amendment tabled by the green group in the european parliament and then on our amendment .
it is not for the chair to judge these things .
all we are doing in terms of setting the structure for the vote is to follow the logical , chronological order of the amendments .
the house is sovereign in terms of the decisions it makes .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , this is a very minor amendment .
i understand it has fairly wide-spread support across the house .
i should just like to read the first line : ' notes in this respect that measures to promote employment should ...
' .
after the word ' should ' we would like to insert the word ' also ' so that it would then read : ' ...
should also be developed by the member states , the regions and local communities and especially by the social partners .
( the oral amendment was accepted )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before we take the final vote i should like to thank the rapporteur for making my job in the chair easier than it could have been .
it was a very complicated vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , i ask your indulgence to invite my colleagues who have not yet signed the declaration on autism to do so .
over 100 colleagues have signed it in the last two days .
i wish to invite the rest to sign it as soon as possible .
under the rules , you cannot so inform the house but you have anyway .
parliament 's decision is fully in keeping with the conclusions of the barcelona conference .
it is time to restore balance to the european union 's cooperation with its partners on the other shores of the mediterranean .
furthermore , with regard to the fisheries sector , we must welcome the financial protocol annexed to the agreement , which amounts to ecu 500 million over four years .
i personally support the breakdown between four actions : financial compensation , development programmes , scientific research and training programmes .
the aid granted must serve to promote employment and development .
the european union is showing solidarity in an important sector of the moroccan economy .
this solidarity must also be displayed in other sectors .
a vote in favour is virtually certain , but we shall have to wait a few months before giving a boost to renewed general cooperation .
we voted in favour , because this is a good agreement , which is the outcome of sound negotiations and an excellent result for relations between the european union and morocco .
that has been achieved .
who could possibly object to better coordination in health policy ?
yet we voted against the proposal and did so for the following reasons .
it is obvious that collecting data serves a wider purpose than merely evaluating the present community policy .
the background is the continuing harmonisation of the health systems themselves .
that goal is now just a step too far .
if these systems grow towards each other , then that is all very well .
but if brussels deliberately dictates that path , then that is an undesirable development in our view .
mr president , for some years now the european union has had a number of public health programmes in an attempt to bring europe closer to the man in the street .
even european programmes to combat cancer , aids and smoking have difficulty resisting the test of subsidiarity .
subsidising national programmes is basically nothing other than recycling money .
money which is first of all transferred to the union and then after a lengthy process of project selection is finally returned to base .
the value of a european approach is in serious doubt .
the problem facing a policy on public health in many countries is the inability to pay for care .
costs have soared through the roof .
but the question of how much money should be paid for health care should be answered by the people involved . it is a national affair .
commissioners and members of the european parliament have no business saying anything here .
if the national authorities can hardly come to grips with it then nothing will be gained by tackling it on a wider scale .
europe should not get over ambitious by trying to manage public health policy .
even the very definition of a hospital bed creates problems .
a european monitoring system is out of the question .
in my opinion the development of a worthwhile european policy on public health is a dream .
let europe concentrate its forces on other affairs .
this is what is proposed in the commission 's document , which the rapporteur has skilfully amended .
the fundamental choices which the member states will be obliged to make are important and will have a bearing on the future of the european project itself .
the european parliament had intended to propose the establishment of a genuine european health observatory , along the lines of those being set up in other fields .
however , the majority in the council preferred to restrict the programme to one of simple coordination - exploiting , as usual , the different traditions and reservations of the health sector and the budgetary constraints in this area .
the outline of the health monitoring system proposed by the commission is certainly somewhat blurred , but whatever form this new instrument takes , we wish it to be practicable and effective .
the european parliament also wished , in general terms , health professionals , ngos and the paramedical sector as a whole to be more closely associated with the definition of the broad outlines of health policy .
i am not entirely convinced that this wish was taken into account by the commission .
it is time , therefore , to ensure the involvement of the citizens and health professionals in the taking of tomorrow 's major decisions .
in the commission 's own terms , the proposed health monitoring system is designed to :
as long as the data provided is harmonized , this will make it easier to compare information and adjust national health policies . '
i repeat : medicine in the twenty-first century must be more resolutely focused on prevention .
we have much to gain from this , and let us make no mistake : a well-managed prevention policy will enable us to safeguard the integrity of our endangered healthcare systems .
by spending in advance , we spend less later on .
if operations were carried out as soon as the warning signs appeared , there would be fewer deaths and tragedies .
i hope that this commission proposal - even if i do not believe that it is as accomplished as the house would have wished - will constitute a first step towards establishing this medicine of tomorrow .
leopardi report ( a4-0091 / 96 )
the creation of a european health card , as repeatedly called for by the european parliament , will represent a step in this direction , and we therefore wish to congratulate mr leopardi on his report .
once again , we add our voice to this positive request .
furthermore , the national health cards are subject to the standards and criteria governing information / registration applicable in the member state in question , which restricts the scope for misusing information .
moreover , the report is an example of the numerous own-initiative reports from the ep in the health sector , which have no overall strategic basis , and cut down the time available for actual legislative work .
these are the reasons for which i voted in favour of this report .
the idea is simple : to enable european citizens travelling around europe to have on their person , at all times , the information on their state of health allowing them to be treated properly , wherever they are .
this would represent a genuine step forward in making the daily lives of our citizens easier .
this idea has been on the table since 1981 , and parliament has adopted a number of resolutions on the subject .
now , pursuant to article 138b of the ec treaty , it can request the submission of a corresponding legislative proposal .
mr leopardi 's report indicates that the legal basis would be article 129 on health policy , whereby the european union may encourage and coordinate the member states ' actions in the sphere of public health .
two issues , in my view , are particularly important .
the first concerns respect for the confidentiality of the information contained on the cards , and the confidence that citizens can place in the competent authorities wherever they go .
and the second concerns acceptance of the card throughout europe .
this will inevitably be a long-term enterprise , especially in that it involves an area where the community 's competence is limited .
it is not the view of the danish social democrats that the eu should pursue an actual health policy .
the drawing up of health policies should continue to be a task carried out as closely as possible to the citizen , with the public exercising the maximum influence .
there are widely differing views in the eu on the basic principles of health policy , and the best method of ensuring quality for the individual is therefore through a decentralised health policy .
mr leopardi 's report on a health card would require resources which cannot be justified by the card 's potential use .
the card would have to be used throughout the health system , which would require the procurement of electronic equipment and the electronic input of data .
a number of people would have this card issued individually , and there would have to be training on a massive scale in the use of cards and equipment .
in addition there are the running costs , altogether a very costly business .
the advantages are not so great as they appear to be at first sight .
practical , security and ethical problems , together with the fact that only europe is covered , restrict the scope for its use .
on the basis of a medical technology assessment , this report would inevitably be rejected .
the report should in other respects be viewed in the context of many mps ' wish for a federal health policy , in which health costs are covered by the eu .
however , there are also very positive aspects to the proposal , including easier access to treatment abroad , but significantly better provision can be made for those aspects in other ways .
the popular movement cannot vote in favour of this report , in that we consider it to be far too narrowly conceived .
if a form of health card is to be devised , then it should extend far further than the eu 's borders , and we would like to see something established at the wto level for example .
we also see a danger in adopting an eu health card since we fear that it will be a step towards further integration and finally lead to a common eu health policy .
we do not want that .
the individual member states should continue to be able to pursue an independent health policy .
we find that a health card containing information about sexual orientation , for example , is quite unacceptable . and we also believe that it should be voluntary to have a health card or not .
in conclusion , we would add that experience should always be exchanged both within and outside the european union , but we are opposed to monitoring systems of any kind , including any in the health sector .
wynn report ( a4-0098 / 96 )
mr president , our group did not vote in favour of mr wynn 's report granting the commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget for 1994 .
i should first like to make some remarks concerning the procedure .
as i pointed out yesterday in the general debate , eight separate reports were the subject of a joint debate .
taking into account the breaks in the sitting , this debate lasted less than two hours .
there were very few contributors other than the main speakers from the committee on budgets .
consequently , the debate received little input , and today very little time was devoted to the votes .
i note that no amendments were tabled .
so there will be virtually no explanations of vote on this subject .
this is revealing , in my view , of a negative trend which i must condemn .
in view of the fact that the committee on budgets is failing to assume its responsibilities , therefore , we voted against the wynn report .
wynn report ( a4-0096 / 96 )
mr president , i had the opportunity to express my views on the discharge yesterday , and once again , a little while ago , in connection with mrs aelvoet 's proposal for referral back to committee .
and i would point out that the foundation 's spending - ecu 810 000 , or 0.04 % of the edf - was the pretext used for refusing the discharge .
that is the only irregularity .
and i accept that it is an irregularity .
are the disastrous political consequences of a negative decision on the edf 's accounts not likely to undermine the acp countries ' confidence in the member states ' commitment towards them ?
the institutional ploy in which the majority of members are engaging is unacceptable . it discredits this parliament .
we cannot use a report , regardless of its substance , as a pretext for engaging in deliberations on structural or institutional problems .
we did this with regard to loans to south africa .
now we are doing it again with regard to cooperation with the acp countries .
our group refuses to participate in this institutional ploy , this continuing squabble .
it is for this reason that it did not vote in favour of mr wynn 's report .
there is no real democratic control over the utilization of the european development fund , whilst in the member states , development aid expenditure is controlled by the national parliaments .
this is an area in which the usefulness of pursuing policies jointly under a community procedure has not been demonstrated .
the undersigned agree with the court of auditors ' criticisms of the shortcomings of the european development fund 's management and the minimal scrutiny to which the fund 's payments are subject .
we are also critical of the lack of logic in the legal and juridical framework governing the edf .
however , unlike the report we do not believe that parliament should be given increased budgetary or legislative powers .
the edf should continue to be managed by the member states and audited by nationally appointed auditors .
discharge should be granted by the national parliaments , which are the bodies with most democratic legitimacy .
the are group 's decision to vote against granting the commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the european development funds for the 1994 financial year is based on the following two reasons :
this is hardly reassuring . in fact , waste is inherent in a community budgetary procedure that is characterized by irresponsibility .
firstly , there is the irresponsibility due to the financial structure . europe is a suction and force pump .
80 % of expenditure is managed by the member states . in these circumstances , does it make sense for it to pass through brussels ?
should the subsidiarity principle not lead to part of community expenditure being relinquished ?
secondly , there is the irresponsibility due to the political structure . the cohesion fund , the structural funds and certain internal policies are designed to create a support base for the european community .
but creating support bases and budgetary discipline are , by their very nature , mutually exclusive .
this should lead to a revision of the financial perspective : not upwards - towards ever increasing expenditure and taxation - but , on the contrary , downwards - towards a drastic reduction of expenditure and revenue .
poggiolini report ( a4-0051 / 96 )
we are all aware that the population of the european union is living longer and ageing .
we must welcome this phenomenon , which is proof of the constant improvement of living and hygiene conditions .
nevertheless , we must also prepare for its many consequences .
the increase in lifespan is leading to a rise in the incidence of age-related diseases - in particular , alzheimer 's disease .
we cannot ignore the fact that by the year 2000 , around 8 million european citizens will be affected .
the consequences of this irreversible degenerative disease are above all human .
the progressive alienation and physical decline of an elderly person cause immense suffering to both the patient and his or her family and carers .
given the extent of alzheimer 's disease , however , the amount of financial resources and medical staff devoted to tackling it are totally inadequate .
i unreservedly support the rapporteur 's call on the commission to implement a programme of measures to combat this disease .
similarly , i would urge the commission to draw up , in collaboration with the member states , a white paper on the different approaches to alzheimer 's disease in the european union .
let us enrich our collective knowledge with the experiences of the different member states .
let us join our efforts to establish the specific causes of this disease .
failing to spend sufficient money on research into the disease is bound to mean having to spend more money on dealing with its consequences .
in addition to this essential but futile humanitarian expenditure , therefore , let us make a positive investment in eradicating this scourge - god willing - once and for all .
naturally , all this will require adequate financial resources to be provided , with a view to enabling coherent action to be taken to combat this disease .
in voting against the report on alzheimer 's disease , i am expressing dissatisfaction with the lack of an overall strategy within the health sector for rare diseases and , with it , european cooperation on these illnesses .
the fact that an own-initiative report has been drawn up on alzheimer 's disease is not wrong in itself , but why this disease in particular ?
what about all the other rare diseases where there is a need for greater research ?
it would have been a better idea in the first place to have devised a common strategy for rare diseases and , in that context , discuss the priorities for community action .
the incidence of alzheimer 's disease in advanced countries , where it is mainly concentrated , is already high .
the absolute number of victims is already considerable and comparable with that of other virus diseases , such as aids .
could this be mainly because it is believed that alzheimer 's disease affects mainly the aged ?
so far there have only been research programmes of limited scope , while the financing of those programmes falls far short of the associated scientific and social interest .
' senile dementia ' , as it is known , is not the target of a single expenditure programme by the welfare organizations .
however , in the immediate future , finance must also be provided for research on the prevention , diagnosis and treatment of the disease .
cabrol report ( a4-0094 / 96 )
ladies and gentlemen , what a long way we have come !
we can finally dare to talk of carrying out tests and telling infected donors not to give any more blood - although you would think that was the least that should be done .
we can finally dare to talk about promoting the use of self-transfusion , something which until very recently was prohibited , for reasons which in fact were far more ideological than practical .
our reasoned words were met with nothing but scorn .
today , those who contradicted us stand accused of the infamous charge of contaminating the population .
i have already had an opportunity - yesterday evening , in plenary - to express my support for the commission communication and mr cabrol 's report .
today , i wish to reiterate the importance of ensuring the safety of blood products through the testing of donations and the application of stringent circulation and storage requirements .
i also wish to stress the need for a large-scale information and awareness campaign on blood and blood donation , with a view to achieving self-sufficiency in europe .
may we never forget the tragedy of all those recipients of transfusions who were infected for want of adequate tests and safety measures - even if the information on aids available at the time was inadequate .
that must serve as a lesson for the future and prompt us to introduce even more stringent safety requirements .
i have chosen to vote against the report on safety in the blood sector and self-sufficiency in blood , because i see no special grounds why the community should be self-sufficient in blood .
this debate on the safety of transfusions and self-sufficiency in blood and blood products raises an important social issue .
a choice must be made between the defence of moral principles and the pursuit of profit .
the house was able to highlight these dangers during a special debate in september 1993 .
the commission was required to take account of parliament 's concerns in its communication of december 1994 , which is the subject of this report .
our group 's position is based on an inviolable basic principle : that the human body is not a commodity .
we believe that the human body and any organs or substances obtained from it are inalienable and non-marketable .
our position coincides with that outlined in the report by the committee on the environment - a report which we are all the more happy to support now that it has been improved and strengthened by our amendments .
voluntary blood donor associations have long been pressing the commission to take action in this important area of public health .
these associations have always stressed the need for blood donations to be voluntary and unpaid .
this , their basic principle , is designed to guarantee both self-sufficiency and absolute safety in the supply and use of blood and blood products .
it is the trade in blood and the pursuit of profit which threaten to introduce the risk of contamination , through inadequate or lax controls and failure to comply with rules and time limits throughout the transfusion chain .
let me say that thanks to the effective action taken by the luxembourg red cross and voluntary blood donor associations , luxembourg has managed to ensure both self-sufficiency and absolute compliance with all safety and hygiene requirements .
blood , and the products obtained and extracted from it , are extremely important therapeutic substances by means of which medical science offers substantial help in both acute and chronic diseases .
the methods used up till now must be re-examined as responsibly and sensitively as possible , as well as the rules relating to the system of blood donation and its safe therapeutic use in patients .
current regulations involve omissions and inadequacies that are responsible for the results of the practices in force for the production and disposal of blood products .
the development of voluntary blood donation must be the most important contribution to covering the demand for blood used to cater for the therapeutic needs of patients .
however , that source must go together with reliable and responsible clinical and laboratory support .
liaison and cooperation between the relevant services in the member states must be facilitated , to guarantee coordinated action in the context of the therapeutic use of blood and the avoidance of disease transmission by biological factors .
we cannot legislate to ensure ethical conduct .
turin european council
widening must therefore be reconciled with deepening - but how will this be possible whilst respecting the fundamental principle of maintaining a single institutional framework ?
in these circumstances , we are not surprised to find , in the summary of the european council 's conclusions , a lack of any clear vision of europe 's future .
will the intergovernmental conference succeed in reconciling these two conflicting demands ?
however , the igc is burdened with an even more serious problem : that of the single currency .
officially , the conference is not meant to be addressing this issue , since the decision has already been taken .
in reality , however , the preparations for the single currency are bringing to light a number of serious institutional problems which remain to be resolved .
mr h&auml;nsch himself drew attention to this in his speech at the turin summit .
i shall quote him : ' europe 's currencies will be brought within the community domain .
economic policy , however , will not .
it is not good for this situation to continue .
the union needs global macroeconomic management . '
it must simply be able to exercise better the competences which it already enjoys . '
the contradiction reflected by these two quotes is common to all the union 's institutions .
one statement derives from the need to respect public opinion , the other from the need to support the single currency .
following the igc , one of the two - respect for public opinion , or support for the single currency - must prevail .
we do not want such a state .
we want it all the less because , behind all the fine speeches about a people 's europe , transparency , democracy , employment and prosperity , lies petty political manoeuvring .
at maastricht , we paid dearly for the agreement of portugal , spain , greece and ireland , with the creation of the cohesion fund .
this year , it is the united kingdom with which we shall have to compromise .
the spectre of mad cow disease hung over the turin summit .
the member states have agreed to pay 70 % of the cost of slaughtering old british cows at the end of their productive life .
this is a wasted effort , however , since the british government is already contesting the legality of the ban on its beef exports at the european court of justice .
and , to cap it all , the conclusion of the intergovernmental conference will have to wait until after the general election is held in the united kingdom !
whatever next !
if the revision of the treaties were to be the key issue in a democratic election enabling european citizens to express their views , that really would be something .
once again , hidden behind the great plans and fine speeches lie quibbling , horse-trading , undeclared aims and financial designs .
no : whatever clothes you try to dress this monster in , we want nothing to do with such a europe .
the intergovernmental conference , in its present form , is in danger of becoming a hotch-potch .
in the absence of a clear analysis of the world situation , there is no real principle underpinning the conference .
let us take the case of the fight against unemployment and external policy .
the reality which we are refusing to see and put a name to is the following . today , there is only one major power left in the world : the united states .
having played a decisive role in the victory in the second world war , in 1989 , the united states won the cold war with the soviet union .
the united states is in a position to lay down the law to the international community .
in economic terms , this is the law of unrestricted freedom of trade , from which , for historical reasons , the big american companies are able to profit most .
the free trade imposed by the united states calls into question the various social protection systems which exist in europe .
it is at the root of both the relocations which are leading to the rise in unemployment in the member states , and the increasing pressure to reduce wages and even the purchasing power of the mass of workers .
because it will not call into question the ' leadership ' of the united states - which would not prevent friendship with the american people , however - the european union is subject to this global law .
as a result , it cannot tackle unemployment at its root , and it is proposing no more than stop-gap measures and limited adjustments .
in political terms , europe is obliged to support the establishing of the new world order as defined by the united states .
whether the member states retain their freedom or speak with a single voice , whether external policy decisions are taken unanimously , by majority or qualified majority , nothing will change this fundamental reality .
and what are europe 's plans for the world order ?
they do not exist .
they would have to be defined on the basis of national realities , and we are a long way from that .
in these circumstances , the igc will bring no improvement , other than in procedural details .
the european union seems to be afflicted with the same disease as byzantium at the time of its decline : a lack of self-assertion and a lack of courage .
europe today too often gives the sad impression of being an association of shopkeepers - prisoners of their own interests , incapable of either solving current problems collectively or mapping out a clear vision of the future .
it is in this light that i cast my vote on the joint motion for a resolution .
we want the eu to continue to be an organisation for civil cooperation between independent states .
we also believe that the intergovernmental conference should be urged by the european parliament to take up the issue of the emu convergence criteria and recognise the link between unemployment and those criteria .
the national front is committed to defending the identity of the peoples of europe , their sovereignty and independence , and their inalienable right and freedom to choose their own destiny .
clearly , these legitimate demands are in conflict with those of the postmaastricht european muddle which the igc is preparing for us .
in any event , the national front demands that the peoples of europe should be directly consulted in a referendum to decide on the approval or rejection of maastricht ii .
much less technocracy and much more direct democracy can only benefit europe .
increasing unemployment and poverty in europe will not be solved by a further expansion of the eu 's political influence .
increasing supranationalism within the union will only remove political decision-makers still further from the people .
democracy becomes difficult to discern when , because of ambiguous political structures , decision-makers at national or european level can blame the problems faced by society on one another .
it is my firm belief that the european union should be a forum for cooperation between sovereign states in which ultimate accountability to the voters lies with the national parliaments .
i hope that the intergovernmental conference will produce a result which makes the european union simpler and less bureaucratic .
a large majority of our group could not support the resolution because it falls far short of the reforms that are needed in the eu today .
instead of addressing the burning issues that the eu is already facing and will face in the foreseeable future , the review conference provided for in the maastricht treaty is restricted to institutional reforms in the narrowest sense .
in this way it has squandered another opportunity to make good its own claim to an active role in the development of the reform process .
alongside that failure , any individual textual nuances over which we might quibble pale into insignificance .
the message to parliament is the same one that europe ought to take to heart in the global context : ask not what the world can do for you - ask what you can do for the world .
but a genuine process of democratic reform of the eu is obviously still a long way off !
oostlander report ( a4-101 / 96 )
nevertheless , the diversity of these countries and their differences - not least economic and social - from the member states of the union will make this process a difficult one .
how can we accomplish it quickly ?
what kind of institutions will enable us to assimilate these disparate nations ?
the turin european council gave the intergovernmental conference a mandate to seek solutions , but regrettably failed to provide guidelines for a specific vision of the future institutional architecture of an enlarged europe .
the oostlander report , which was presented to the house today , corresponds to an ultra-federalist concept of the future , which raises more problems than it solves , and which now appears to have minority support in europe .
it assumes that the countries of central and eastern should accede to the community en bloc , with institutional unity , and only some slight differences as regards their respective speeds .
with these words , the oostlander report aims in particular at the extension of qualified majority voting , which is meant to facilitate the functioning of an enlarged europe .
we might well ask how .
because if it is difficult to take decisions unanimously in an organization with 25 members , it is unacceptable to take decisions by majority in an organization with 25 disparate members .
in reality , the only solution is to abandon the dogma of institutional unity and accept variable geometry .
this also means that we must opt for a european partnership of nations , rather than a federal europe .
this will enable us to welcome the countries of central and eastern europe more effectively and more quickly .
in a european partnership of nations , for example , what would prevent these countries from acceding without delay to an intergovernmental organization such as europol , with a view to combating more effectively large-scale international crime ?
mr president , i subscribe entirely to the views expressed by my colleagues , and i shall therefore confine myself to making three specific points .
i fear , mr president , that this idea is more of a slogan than a proven fact .
this tendency is to be found in the oostlander report on which i am making this explanation of vote together with my colleague mr van der waal , on whose behalf i also speak .
in practical terms this means putting a brake on a speedy expansion towards the east . that is unacceptable to us on both moral and security policy grounds .
furthermore we regret that the report pays no attention to the geographical and cultural confines of europe .
that is necessary to prevent any arbitrary accession of new countries .
any attempt at enlargement must be directed at countries which belong to the sphere of european culture and influence of western christianity including the reformation .
good neighbourliness is important , especially in international relations , but before one invites the neighbours into one 's own house one should have a good think .
the iron curtain between west and east seems to be drawn back and even tucked away , but the economic gulf between the two europes is still there .
proponents of enlargement always assume that enlargement will benefit both the present and the future member states .
that is undoubtedly true .
just think of our domestic and foreign security and of democratic stability .
but the fact that there is a price to be paid and that there may even be drawbacks is often passed over or even forgotten .
this is partly because the consequences of this kind of accession are not clear or are inadequately recognised .
what will happen to decision-taking , to the institutions , to the community budget in general and the budget headings for the cohesion funds and structural funds in particular ?
i am not prepared either as a politician or as a private citizen to write a blank cheque .
we would also be wrong to raise hopes in the relevant countries which might not be fulfilled .
despite the german wish to welcome poland and the czech republic just now .
despite the swedish wish to allow the baltic sea countries to accede .
self-interest is a poor adviser in this kind of negotiation .
this also applies to the reluctance of portugal , spain , italy and greece who are thinking of a drastic cut-back in aid from the european union to the mediterranean countries .
in the final analysis we are talking about extending the european union and not replacing it with a large free trade area with a dwindling community pillar and a dominant intergovernmental pillar .
we , the undersigned , have voted for the report .
we did so because we believe that the report gives consideration to many of the problems involved in the accession of the eastern european states to the eu .
this is in marked contrast to much of the over-simplified propaganda which is being disseminated in the eu , not least in sweden , concerning the advantages of the accession of the eastern european states .
it is also very important , as the report says , that those countries which elect not to join should be granted good conditions for trade and cooperation with the eu .
the report also lacks a serious analysis of the security policy problems , not least as regards russia , which may arise in connection with the eu 's planned development of an integrated defence and military dimension .
the authors of the report consider that enlargement to the east is undoubtedly possible in theory , but will be far more difficult in practice .
in fact , it seems as if europe is opening its borders to the south , but closing them to the east .
the purpose of this report , like that of the commission white paper on the same subject , is to review the progress made by the associated countries in their transition towards accession to the european union .
given the uncertain prospects , and the indecisiveness - not to say positive lack of commitment - on the part of our countries , they appear to be making all the effort .
in this context , it is important to point out , firstly , that the principle of the accession of the countries of central and eastern europe has been established and must remain so .
we must avoid breaking the camel 's back by imposing unrealistic preconditions on the applicant countries , or indulging in petty accounting .
the main obstacle to the smooth progress of a transition which should logically end in accession is , to my mind , the over-cautiousness of the union member states .
enlargement has a price , that cannot be denied .
but the price of our indifference and selfishness will undoubtedly be far higher , because they threaten to deprive the countries of central and eastern europe of political prospects which are essential to the success of their transition .
the report on the central and eastern european countries ' participation in cooperation in the internal market is very well thought out .
the rapporteur deserves praise for his excellent analysis of the problems to be solved as part of the preparations for the forthcoming enlargement of the eu .
and - as the rapporteur so rightly stresses in his concluding remarks - all the countries have their own particular history and cultural identity , which they naturally want and will be able to preserve within the european union .
it does not automatically mean that the new member states should , or will be able , to accede to the eu en bloc .
the applicant countries are very different , which can duly be taken into account only by conducting accession negotiations with each country separately .
for the same reason , the duration of these negotiations as well as the timing of the individual applicant country 's accession to the eu , may well vary considerably .
it is important that the negotiations with the countries of eastern and central europe which have applied for membership should begin simultaneously .
since the oostlander report does not satisfy our preconditions in the slightest we are unable to vote in favour of it .
tackling the problems and challenges faced by modern society requires the development of exchanges and cooperation in every sphere .
in this context , i am in favour of the enlargement of the union to include the countries of central and eastern europe .
this must provide an opportunity to encourage the development of a democratic europe , based on economic and social progress and forming part of a common vision of international relations .
furthermore , in just a few years , the economic shock therapy experienced by these countries has given rise to considerable social inequalities .
it would be useful , therefore , to carry out a detailed analysis , on a case-by-case basis , of the political , economic and social implications of enlargement for the applicant countries .
i support an approach which is quite different from that of placing workers and economies in competition with each other .
such an approach must be based on the aspirations of the peoples concerned , and on the promotion of human potential , employment , democracy , peace and security .
the campaign for disarmament and demilitarization is thus an essential aspect of our security on the european continent .
the bloc mentality and military designs of organizations such as nato or the western european union will have no place in the europe of the future .
the report contains advances - regarding in particular the defence of human and minority rights , and the intention not to encourage privatization in the fields of culture , education and health , in the interests of social cohesion .
nevertheless , it does also contain dangers .
for all these reasons , i have abstained from voting on the report .
our group abstained from this vote . the reason for our abstention is not that we were in any way unappreciative of the work of mr oostlander and the members who supported him .
wherever he took a stance against the new manifestations of western european isolationism , which mainly lurk behind financial issues , he deserved and he had our support .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
welcome
i wish to announce that our parliament is honoured to welcome in the official gallery a parliamentary delegation from the ukrainian parliament .
this delegation , which is led by mr andrei mostytsky , will have working meetings today and tomorrow with our parliament 's delegation on relations with the ukraine .
i address our greetings to the ukrainian delegation and wish it every success in its contacts and meetings with our parliament .
welcome to you .
chernobyl , prospects for eu involvement
the next item is the statements by the council and the commission , on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the chernobyl accident , on the impact and prospects for european union involvement .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to make it quite clear from the start . chernobyl must and shall be closed down .
it is a monumental affront to human civilization and totally unacceptable that the plant is still in operation .
this is my policy , and the commission 's , and that is how it has been pursued in all fora .
it is now 10 years since the chernobyl accident occurred .
the memory of this tragedy remains as clear as if it had happened yesterday .
it will , unfortunately , remain with us for many generations to come .
chernobyl has become yet another symbol of the unthinkable on a par with very few other human catastrophes .
the shock was so great because this accident not only affected the immediate vicinity , but also areas thousands of kilometres from the scene .
it affected , and continues to affect , all of us directly .
various organizations have analysed the effects on health , the environment and the economy .
sometimes the findings of these investigations are fairly similar , while in other instances , assessments of the consequences of the disaster are quite different .
for example , the who , the commission and other international organizations estimate the number of deaths definitely attributable to the direct effects of radiation at about 30 .
other assessments put the number of deaths resulting from the accident far higher .
but let us not discuss the number of victims at this juncture .
every individual person who dies , or suffers as a result of the accident , is one too many .
ladies and gentlemen , our common position must be that such an accident must never happen again .
the conditions for world-wide cooperation have never been as good as at present .
in contrast with 1986 the world is no longer divided by the cold war .
in place of earlier confrontation , we have now established a network of cooperation with the countries of the former soviet union .
i can illustrate this by means of two examples .
at the end of this week the g7 countries are to hold a summit on nuclear safety with president yeltsin in moscow , which president kuchma will also attend .
such a meeting , which is to deal exclusively with co-operation in these areas , would have been quite unthinkable 10 years ago .
the commission is convinced that it will be able to contribute towards the promotion and spread of a highly developed safety culture at an international level .
the second example is the commission 's satisfaction at president kuchma 's decision to close down chernobyl by the year 2000 .
together with the g7 countries we will continue to work with ukraine and the international financial institutions for complete implementation of the memorandum signed in ottawa in 1995 with that objective .
as regards the health situation in general , the european commission assists via its humanitarian office echo with medical resources and the monitoring of the rural population .
the commission also supplies special equipment for the treatment of thyroid gland cancer in children in kiev and minsk , and is helping to rehabilitate a children 's hospital in minsk .
a programme has been set up to educate and train medical specialists , and facilities for the production of iodized salt and medicine for the treatment of cancer of the thyroid gland are about to be installed .
such measures meet a very specific need , and we should , of course , continue with them .
this applies to programmes such as those in phare and tacis .
an important step forward - as i have already stressed - is the signing of the g7ukraine memorandum on the closure of the chernobyl nuclear power station .
it covers the restructuring of the energy supply sector , an energy investment programme , nuclear safety planning of the social repercussions , economic resources and implementation surveys .
there are about 4 000 people working at the chernobyl plant at present . in addition , the plant provides income for the town of slavuchid .
in addition to solving the problem of the actual chernobyl plant , there is also the problem of dealing with the contaminated waste from the surrounding area .
immediately after the accident in 1986 , the radioactive waste was collected and deposited at between 600-800 different sites , some temporary and some permanent .
in some of the places where waste has been deposited and stored , the ground water has been contaminated , and there is a need for isolating it or carrying out a clean-up operation .
the european commission has also launched an investigation into the various options for the rehabilitation of the regions contaminated by the fallout from the accident .
what have we learnt from this accident ?
then there was the question of reactor safety and the prevention of future accidents .
reactors of the chernobyl type , the so-called rbmk reactors , have never been constructed outside the soviet union .
in 1986 , the nuclear safety authorities and operators of nuclear power stations in the community had learned from the three mile island accident in the usa in 1979 .
this accident highlighted the need to pay greater attention to the human factor , the interface between man and machine , the reliability of the control instruments and to operating instructions .
the chernobyl accident confirmed the importance of these aspects and emphasised further the need for a well prepared disaster plan outside the actual nuclear power station .
the competent authorities in the member states take account of all these aspects when authorizing the operation of nuclear plants .
for its part , the european commission supports the development of these aspects of nuclear safety through numerous groups of experts and study activities .
by means of the second and subsequent framework programmes for research and technological development , and through the activities of the joint research centre , the community is making a major contribution towards the prevention of serious accidents .
together , these activities contribute towards the further strengthening of safety consciousness and the safety of all bodies involved in the safe operation of nuclear plants .
this safety culture results , in turn , in an ongoing improvement of the level of safety in existing and planned plants .
the nuclear safety convention drawn up under the auspices of the international atomic energy organisation in 1994 will make a contribution towards global nuclear safety .
it has been signed by more than 50 states , including the 15 member states of the union , and the former soviet union .
the aim of the convention is to promote a high level of safety in nuclear power plants , to prevent accidents and to minimize their repercussions .
the convention is expected to come into force in 1997 or , possibly , this year .
suppliers of equipment , operators , safety agencies , the relevant national authorities and the european union 's institutions , are each playing their role as laid down in the treaties and national legislation .
but there is still a great deal to be done .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am sorry to have arrived a little late , but i would like to explain the reasons for that .
commissioner bjerregaard has very exhaustively set out everything that has been done by the union , so there is no need for me to exceed my speaking time .
this set of measures , this chapter of the action programme on the environment , also includes and develops a series of legislative documents , directives and regulations which have gradually been adopted over the last ten years .
but as i say , commissioner bjerregaard has already covered all these points in detail .
the council dealt specifically with a number of individual situations relating to reactors in operation .
i will not dwell on this point any further as , once again , commissioner bjerregaard has discussed it in great detail .
this is a brief illustration of the policy lines which the council has proposed and which i think it has followed with great consistency .
all this - as commissioner bjerregaard made very clear , so i shall not go over it again - has naturally raised the problem of structural reform in the energy supply sector .
this understanding sets out a series of measures for restructuring the energy sector , investment in energy , nuclear safety , and dealing with the social aspects .
these form a really organic programme appropriately geared to sustaining the decision of the ukrainian government to close the chernobyl power station by the year 2000 .
the problem of the so-called sarcophagus enclosing reactor no 4 , the source of the explosion , is regarded as a priority .
it is certainly in the interests of the whole international community that this memorandum of understanding with the ukraine be fully implemented within the set deadlines , applying the measures and methods as planned .
i would like to conclude by observing that , in the end , the chernobyl tragedy has introduced a new stage into the nuclear safety culture .
commissioner , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , ten years of effort - little to show .
secondly , the concrete casing of the entombed reactor is unsafe and unstable .
it urgently requires an additional shell , all the more so since the no 3 reactor is right beside it .
thirdly , the human misery goes on .
the environment is contaminated by caesium ; skin diseases , cancers and depopulation are the typical long-term effects .
to reiterate the point in plain terms , the nuclear risk has not lessened since 1986 but has remained exactly the same .
that is why we must all work together in order to take a step forward .
no-one can master this mammoth task alone - neither the ukrainians , nor the eu , nor the industrialized nations .
we must operate hand in hand .
the european union has already invested many million ecus .
the commissioner has kindly given us a very comprehensive account of this effort .
we shall do even more .
we want to provide more help .
it is not easy for ukraine to decommission the chernobyl plant .
chernobyl covers six to seven per cent of national energy requirements .
decommissioning costs a lot of money .
that is why those responsible need assistance .
but we also know that the ukraine is one of the most energy-intensive countries in the world .
the ukrainians consume most energy per head of population .
so when it comes to assistance in the domain of energy supply , parliament and the group of the party of european socialists will ensure that top priority is given to mechanisms for efficient supply .
additional means of meeting the demand for energy , such as combined gas and steam turbine plants , can also be discussed , of course .
there is a realistic prospect of supplying energy without chernobyl , without power stations .
we shall not let ourselves be pressurized into immediate unbridled construction of new power stations , as was suggested in one of today 's newspapers .
the year 2000 is the agreed target date for abandonment , and that is the target for which we must all continue to aim .
mr president , once again , we are discussing chernobyl .
for ten years , there has been nothing but talk , talk , talk .
it was disappointing , commissioner , to hear your statement ; and it was very disappointing , mr president-in-office of the council , to hear more empty words .
if we are simply going to come here and make vague statements , perhaps we should turn our attention to something else .
i do not forget that - as you both rightly said - we are talking about an independent and sovereign country .
and i should like to address the representatives of the people of ukraine who are in the gallery this afternoon : i am sure that it is the ukrainian people who have the greatest interest in shutting down chernobyl .
and it is the ukrainian government too , since all governments respond to the demands of their people .
so why is it not shut down ?
why do we simply talk and hold countless conferences , and it is not shut down ?
for purely economic reasons .
the european union has not contributed usd 4000 million , which i believe is what mr lange said .
it has contributed scarcely ecu 300 million : a pittance .
and so we shall go on speaking in platitudes and making vague statements , like this afternoon , and we shall all continue to despair .
everyone here , everyone in europe , wishes all the chernobyl reactors to be shut down - and as soon as possible .
however , we all wish the people of ukraine to have the improved standard of living which they desperately need .
they are going through hard economic times , although things have improved a little recently .
they have vast energy needs .
it is true that they could save a large amount of energy : however , mr lange , if you have worked in this sector , you will know that saving energy requires large-scale investment .
let us help them to make that investment .
furthermore , commissioner , i think that it would be a good thing if the commission submitted to us a report containing some genuine data .
you said that some reports refer to 30 deaths .
clearly , there have been many more .
those were just the 30 direct deaths at the time the fire was extinguished .
another report refers to hundred of thousands of deaths , hundred of thousands of cases of thyroid cancer .
and do not come back to us next year and repeat that safety is threatened , that democracy ...
no , no , no !
we want solutions .
and we want rapid solutions , because absolutely nothing has been done for the last ten years .
for example , you could begin by financing the siting , environmental impact assessment and initial construction of a vast 2000 megawatt combined-cycle power plant to replace chernobyl 's blocks 1 and 3 .
provide all the money .
it will be worth it , for what we are doing now is far more costly .
does the money exist ?
in theory , no : but you can find it if you want to .
you will have parliament 's full support , and i am sure that you will also have the support of the 15 member states .
furthermore , we shall be investigating ways to collaborate in building a new sarcophagus , and shutting down and dismantling the entire chernobyl plant - which may cost a further usd 2300 million .
commissioner , mr president-in-office , this will be your data - the g7 's - at the meeting in moscow at the end of the year .
in any event , you can count on parliament 's full support for whatever you do : but please do something serious .
we do not want simply words .
i would merely remind you that in countries as far away as germany thyroid cancers continue to increase cyclically as a function of the biological cycle , linked in turn to plants , animals and rain .
certainly an important step was taken with the memorandum of understanding signed at ottawa by the g7 countries .
clearly our intervention in the ukraine must proceed with caution so as not to deprive that country of 6 % of the energy it needs .
that will be the aim of our committee .
the situation has never been so bad and never been so dangerous .
but we shall not be doing any of this !
we are going to spend 18 months discussing the ' list cost planning ' for new nuclear power-stations .
after all , the french nuclear lobby , which has its representatives in the commission , g7 and euratom , is going to try and defend its position in this chamber .
the european parliament must not be in cahoots with this measure and parliament must ask for what mrs estevan and mr langer called for !
first question : how often will it be necessary to keep adding new layers to the chernobyl sarcophagus ?
how much does that cost , and how many times is it foreseen that this will have to be done in the future ?
every ten years , and for how many centuries will that have to happen in the future ?
what is the estimated cost of each new layer on the sarcophagus and what are the risks involved ?
second question : which are the other nuclear stations that represent imminent hazards ?
you spoke about those in the former soviet union and in eastern europe .
yet you too , mr president-in-office , are pressing for the completion of the khmelnisky ii and rovno stations to be financed with one-billion ecu .
why ?
on what reasoning , if there is more generally any reasoning behind your action ?
which other stations are dangerous in the long term ?
have you anything to tell us about the kosloduy station in bulgaria , where accidents have already happened ?
perhaps you are waiting for a more serious accident to take place before turning your attention towards it ?
are there any prospects of an agreement with bulgaria for kosloduy to close , or are we going to wait for victims there too and only then turn up to treat the cancers ?
finally : are the most modern technologies in the rest of europe free from risk ?
do they not cost ?
is there any thought , at european level and as a long-term prospect , of closing down all the nuclear energy stations and turning to other forms of energy in the long term ?
because otherwise , i think we are debating here without any essential meaning .
mr president , many roads lead to the mca - the maximum credible accident .
for all our dealings with accidents and disaster , is it perhaps the case that , despite the misery they have caused , we have yet to learn our lesson from them ?
thousands , indeed hundreds of thousands , of children are ill or have been born handicapped , and the rate is increasing .
although areas of land the size of the netherlands are contaminated , we have allowed time to elapse without taking action .
the rbmk and vver reactors are scrap heaps and will remain so , and retrofits will do nothing to alter that !
they have no emergency cooling systems and no fire-prevention mechanisms , and it is of very little use , for instance , when the operators say that they have good firefighting teams .
there is a lack of instruction manuals .
safety precautions on site are absolutely minimal .
the sum of ecu 550 million has already been pumped in from the phare and tacis programmes .
what do we have to show for it ?
first of all , 90 % of the funds have been disbursed in western europe on safety studies .
strictly speaking , the object of the exercise has been to open the door to new markets .
we have not achieved any more security at these sites .
there can surely be no question of that .
what has occurred is not a reduction but rather a prolongation of the risk .
that has to be acknowledged once and for all .
we are categorically opposed to the completion of two reactors which are already in an absolutely desolate condition and cannot be properly completed .
for six billion dollars we could have new cogeneration plants , generating both heat and power , with an output of 10 000 megawatts .
instead of that , money is being squandered so that some companies can earn more profits .
it is scandalous , unacceptable and a disgrace to the european union .
let me say one more thing . in western europe we have many reactors that are no better than those .
if we continue to pursue the same policies here , the next mca will come along as swiftly and surely as night follows day !
mr president , i welcome the representatives from ukraine to whom all our hearts go out .
could i ask everyone a question who may be listening to this : will the next nuclear disaster following chernobyl be in chernobyl ?
that is a chilling but a real question .
poor ukraine - they have been told that they have not lost 125 , 000 people but that they have only lost a few hundred people .
with the lack of proper arrangements in many other reactors - because chernobyl was only the fifth worst - we are going to have another disaster and the eu will have a great deal of responsibility .
we must decide that the time for talking has really ended and really put our hands in our pockets and give the money that is necessary to clean up this situation .
we know that ukraine is heavily dependent on this type of energy , so we have to face up to this .
we know the cost of nuclear decommissioning and we should take a hard look at nuclear energy .
i happen to belong to an anti-nuclear party , i am president of it in scotland .
i sit with colleagues who are pro-nuclear because france has a different attitude to that .
i can understand that .
sweden was the most heavily nuclear-dependent country , and yet they have taken a different attitude .
perhaps we have to look at the whole question of our energy policy .
if we do not know how to destroy the monster we create , have we any right to create any more monsters ?
that is really the question .
sitting up there are brave people who have come to see us today and i hope i have the chance to meet them .
we have to pledge our solidarity , not just with words , but with finance .
mr president , chernobyl has gone down in history as the biggest nuclear disaster of all times .
the disaster is imprinted on the minds of many residents of ukraine .
and not just there .
the consequences are imprinted on the bodies of people and on their descendants .
it happened only ten years ago .
how many tens of thousands of people are still facing day in day out the gruesome consequences of over-radiation ?
we do not even have accurate numbers .
that is why it is right that the international community should continue to remember them .
a tenth anniversary such as this serves the purpose of focusing public attention .
have we really no idea ?
closure is the only answer .
i fervently hope that the ukrainian government will give its cooperation .
if the rich countries come up with sufficient money then nothing will stand in their way .
but we have not reached that stage yet .
has the time not come to decide to close down the remaining fifteen power stations of the chernobyl type ?
everyone knows that this will be extremely costly , both for the dismantling of the installations and for the provision of alternative energy supplies .
but the international community must recognise that this is a problem that is far too great for an individual country or group of countries to tackle alone .
in financial terms the former soviet union is not up to it .
it would be a demonstration of international solidarity if not only the g7 but all affluent countries were to agree on a plan to make these dangerous power stations disappear from the face of the earth .
the collapse of the iron curtain has created a number of new responsibilities for the countries of the west .
now that we can afford to spend gradually less on defence the money saved should at least be used to improve the situation in the former east bloc .
and that includes closing down these power stations .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it was the chernobyl disaster which made public opinion aware of the dangers of nuclear technology .
but that was ten years ago .
at the time , the greens certainly expressed concern at these problems , but being bound by political friendships and dependence , they were silent on the subject of the building of nuclear power stations in the east .
the national front , for its part , has been making its views on this subject clear since 1978 .
it has always been cautious as regards the whole dogma of nuclear technology .
moreover , this was the subject of one of our first pamphlets .
in 1980 , we campaigned in favour of civil protection , insisting on the need to build nuclear shelters .
and , in 1986 , the disaster which we had been fearing for nearly ten years occurred .
at the same time , he called for the implementation of a responsible and effective security policy for times of both peace and conflict .
by way of example , only seven radioactive fallout warning systems had been commissioned at that time .
naturally , none of them was yet in operation .
as for the budget allocated to civil safety in the nuclear sector , it was simply ridiculous .
it was unbelievable !
we have consistently warned in advance of the disasters that have occurred in these closing decades of the twentieth century .
nuclear energy seemed to be a taboo subject .
furthermore , information was withheld , on the pretext of not causing panic .
this is arbitrary and dangerous behaviour which gives cause for concern .
the majority of the &eacute;lite were wrong .
insanity prevailed over reason .
our leaders were blinded by the dogma - condemned by certain colleagues - of progress , mass consumerism and free trade .
why should we be surprised if cows go mad when , sadly , they have been turned into carnivorous cannibals ?
why should we question nuclear technology ?
clearly , nuclear disasters would have ceased long ago if moderation had prevailed over the excitement of all the sorcerer 's apprentices .
ultimately , it is the choice of our form of society which is at fault .
today , the tenth anniversary of the chernobyl disaster leads us to debate this issue - but it is no longer simply a question of chernobyl .
there are dozens of chernobyls .
we should like to know , moreover , as my colleague said earlier , more or less where things stand .
mr president , i am sure we all remember on this day the fear that gripped us 10 years ago .
when we heard the news of the nuclear disaster at chernobyl and followed the trail of nuclear radiation as it crossed europe we felt real fear .
it gripped us deeply .
however , it has diminished ; it has gradually ebbed away .
whilst some actions have been taken , they have proved to be insufficient .
more clearly needs to be done .
the sarcophagus of the chernobyl 4 nuclear reactor could be much better and more effective .
the original clean-up from the original disaster could have been done much better and more effectively .
indeed , as regards the effects upon human health that have occurred in terms of cancer and other sicknesses , much more could and should have been done .
most of all , what should have been done is that we should have stopped the possibility of such a disaster again .
that sadly , is our biggest problem .
that sadly , is our biggest unachieved task .
many reactors of exactly the same kind as chernobyl - in some cases in worse condition than chernobyl - still exist and are in operation in russia and other parts of the cis .
i am sure the commission would agree that this alternative approach to solving the power needs of east and central europe , as opposed to a nuclear programme , is the one that we should pursue .
on this tenth anniversary of the chernobyl disaster we must rekindle our fears and our concerns to ensure that we have the determination to take the action necessary to stop this ever happening again .
we must take hold of the initial agreement in the form of the memorandum of understanding and develop it further at the g7 .
we must close dangerous reactors - not just chernobyl , but elsewhere also - and we must resolve ways in which to find the funding to do so .
we must provide that funding no matter how much it costs .
mr president , 10 years have now passed since the chernobyl nuclear power station disaster .
this accident brought to light that there are numerous power stations in the former soviet union built with the same technology and with a highly unreliable safety record .
some of these are very close to finland , in karelia and other neighbouring areas .
in finland we currently have four nuclear power stations which have worked impeccably and meet western european safety criteria .
the finnish energy supply authorities consider that we need to build a fifth nuclear power station .
there is thus no chance of building new nuclear power stations until people are certain that they are safe .
at the same time we must endeavour to close down these dangerous power stations as soon as possible .
as i have said , there is a great deal of opposition in finland at present to nuclear power , which in practice prevents any further nuclear power stations from being built .
consequently , attention has turned to natural gas .
this would increase the security of gas supply throughout the whole of northern europe , the baltic states and other member states of the european union , and would accordingly reduce the need for nuclear power .
in my opinion this northern gas network should be added to the eu 's europe-wide gas networks .
the matter is being discussed today at the visby conference .
marjatta steniuskaukonen has tabled an amendment to the opinion on the abovementioned gas network .
i would ask you , members of the european parliament present here , to support this amendment by mrs stenius-kaukonen which all members of the finnish parliament across party boundaries support .
when natural gas networks and safety are increased throughout europe , this will tend to reduce fear of nuclear power stations as well .
mr president , mrs bloch von blottnitz , mrs ewing and mr pimenta have said it all today .
this is hard to credit .
although the ukraine authorities have pledged to dismantle the plant by the year 2000 in exchange for international aid for the harnessing of alternative sources of energy , closure cannot come quick enough .
in november last year at the chernobyl second reactor three workmen were exposed to massive doses of radiation and we still have not learned the lesson .
it is vital that the european union plays a central and constructive role in ensuring the practical provision of resources under programmes such as tacis .
this programme is aimed at supporting nuclear safety in the former soviet union .
given the condition of many nuclear power plants there one cannot underestimate the importance of the programme .
however , this programme cannot work unless the european union makes sure that sufficient resources and grants are available for tacis to carry out its task .
finally , as has been said by mrs ewing , chernobyl is not a unique plant .
they exist all over europe .
where will the next nuclear disaster be ?
as an irish member i must refer to the sellafield plant in the uk .
for many years the irish people have lived under a cloud of unease as the sellafield plant has stumbled from one safety misdemeanour to another .
we have had enough of this .
nuclear accidents do not respect borders and no member state can act on its own .
mr president , chernobyl was the accident that could not happen .
it is quite insane to imagine pollution on that scale . just think , they really said that back in the 1970 ' s .
the technology could not go wrong .
that is why some people had some problems explaining themselves 10 years ago .
the answer was , of course , that it was because the soviet union was undemocratic .
it is not that simple .
with all technology of that type there is probably a danger - albeit slight - of an accident .
but if the accident does occur , then the risk is great .
there is only one answer to chernobyl : it must be closed down .
it is the only answer decent people can give to using technology which was anything but harmless .
the truth is , of course , that we in the west also bear a responsibility for promoting this technology .
that is not the answer . energy savings and the use of other forms of energy is the answer .
mr president , ten years ago over two million children were exposed to the fall-out from chernobyl .
it was an accident that appalled the world and released 300 times more radioactivity than fell on hiroshima .
until now there has been a conspiracy to deny that any damage to the health of those people and children is a result of radiation .
the international atomic energy agency nuclear safety division has been at the forefront of this cover-up .
in 1990 the iaea published a health report which stated that there was no evidence of disease linked to fall-out and that the ill health was a result of psychological stress .
this was in spite of mounting evidence of thyroid cancers in children at the time .
because those children were not screened and not treated , some of them died , and the iaea is responsible for those deaths .
in 1995 over 400 cases of thyroid cancers were documented in children .
this was not finally accepted until the who conference in geneva last year when the findings of the thyroid project , based in minsk , were adopted .
the who radiation expert has gone on record about the opposition to this project encountered at all stages of its development .
i say to you today that one slow , lingering death of one child from radiation is one too many !
beyond the visible and immediate effects on children , the world health organization 's scientists concluded that radioactivity has a range of effects on health , including higher rates of cancers and heart disease .
but the iaea are now trying to do the same thing to others as they did to the children with thyroid cancer : they are effectively denying these people screening and treatment .
in the russian federation , they have collected data discussed at the minsk conference showing significant rates of cancer and leukaemia are dose-related - which means radiation-induced .
the iaea at their conference in vienna last week still deny these findings , although the ukrainian , russian and belarussian delegations dispute their figures .
commissioner , i would say that the iaea are not competent to make judgements and pronouncements on health and i ask you to state that the world health organization is ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
another subject touched on by the commissioner was that of the culture of nuclear safety .
an accident at a nuclear power station , in the east or the west , is simply a question of a greater or lesser probability .
please , do not finance the construction of any new nuclear reactors in the former soviet union !
i know what i am talking about , because i come from a region which is threatened by the cattenom reactors built by edf .
mr president , ten years on from the explosion in the fourth reactor of the chernobyl power station the emergency continues , above all in belarus and the ukraine .
in 1995 , according to the belarussian health ministry , 400 out of 500 babies with pathologies had cancer .
the incidence of cancer in the infant population is 50 times higher than 10 years ago .
official sources put deaths in the ukraine at 180 , 000 and birth rate , death rate and cancer statistics are similar to those described earlier .
the european union must also intervene through the tacis and phare programmes with the countries of eastern europe and the former soviet union , so that they gradually abandon or convert the at-risk nuclear power stations .
mr president , i should like to begin by expressing my disappointment to the commissioner and the president-in-office of the council .
the other rbmk reactors , a total of 15 , are still on line , after all .
we know a lot about the sarcophagus , but we are far from knowing how to deal with it .
the only thing we know about the whole business is that we actually know nothing .
proposals - for which we have paid dearly , i might add - unfortunately abound .
there are also risks in the irradiated areas of the urals or in the former nuclear weapons test site in what is now the republic of kazakhstan , etc .
it is true that we have provided money ; i make it a total of some 600 million dollars given by the west to the former soviet republics .
however , it is estimated that we should need around 15 to 20 billion dollars to do everything the experts have proposed .
it is a package - and let me say this to my honourable colleagues too - it is a package that includes the completion of two vver reactors .
anyone seeking to drop this condition is putting a match to the entire package .
we have to be quite clear about that .
( heckling by mrs bloch von blottnitz ) no , no , we must be aware that the removal of this condition means dismantling and destroying the whole thing .
that is just how it is .
i did not negotiate it , nor am i the ukrainian government , but anyone who seeks to tamper with it must know that he is giving others an excuse to make the whole thing fail .
that would be extremely regrettable .
in russia , ukraine and lithuania , there are still 15 reactors of the same design as chernobyl in operation .
the long-term effects of the disaster on man and the environment have still not been researched .
there are still the most enormous difficulties involved in providing proper medical care for the victims .
that is why i am highly sceptical about the special meeting of the g7 in moscow on 19 and 20 april devoted exclusively to nuclear safety .
there is a conclusive and authoritative study which demonstrates that upgrading the mochovce reactor to western safety standards is not only shortsighted but downright impossible .
the aim of this interest group does not seem to be the prevention of further accidents on the scale of chernobyl but rather the creation of new nuclear risk factors and sheer profiteering .
i call on the commission to reexamine the mochovce project in terms of its danger to europe and , if need be , to take the necessary steps to halt it .
mr president , the problem of outdated energy production stations in the countries of the former eastern block is one of the most serious in europe , and we all know that .
ten years after chernobyl the danger is ever-present , and despite the thousands of deaths the station continues to operate .
on the 19th and 20th of this month in moscow , at a new meeting between the seven and the ukraine , as has already been said , the question of finance is to be discussed .
however , money alone cannot solve the problem , other things are needed as well , most of all a change in our thinking .
because chernobyl is not the only place with problems .
in bulgaria , very close to us , the kosloduy station is considered the next most dangerous after chernobyl since last october when it resumed operation .
despite all the pressures by the european union the date for its operation to cease is constantly being postponed .
the nuclear station of metzamor in armenia is also regarded as problematic and others too have been mentioned here , while many more still are likely to emerge in the future .
mr president , have we not learned anything in the last ten years ?
scientific evidence shows that 60 000 deaths were directly caused by the after-effects of the chernobyl accident and not 30 . perhaps they were the ones who died immediately .
innumerable people became ill .
six hundred thousand people had to be evacuated .
the ebrd now wants to make one billion dollars available for the completion of two reactors in ukraine .
that is the price for the closure of chernobyl .
how long shall we continue to support this extremely hazardous technology with its frighteningly inadequate safeguards ?
two days ago we learned that mochovce is to be built with russian and czech money .
i just marvel at all the things for which russia has money .
french and german companies such as siemens will help to build this dangerous nuclear centre .
that is scandalous !
in germany the same sort of reactor did not receive an operating licence .
it is truly scandalous !
mochovce is a nightmare !
it endangers the whole of central europe .
vienna is almost within sight of it .
how many million deaths does the eu need before it will agree to change its energy policy ?
we need different solutions in ukraine , and we need different solutions throughout central europe .
i do not want membership of the eu to be conferred on any country that jeopardizes the health and safety of the people of another country .
i now ask the council whether its policy on slovakia is changing as regards the talks on union membership .
mr president , on 20 december 1995 , a memorandum of understanding was signed in ottawa by the representatives of the g7 , the european commission and ukraine .
this memorandum of understanding contains something good : the decision to shut down chernobyl by the year 2000 .
it also contains something very bad , however : the decision to complete work on the two nuclear power stations at khmelnisky and rovno .
for the house 's information , the work of completing these two nuclear sites will be carried out by european firms : electrabel of belgium and iveo of finland , under the supervision of electricit&eacute; de france .
chernobyl and its aftermath are not only a problem for ukraine and the other affected regions in russia and belarus , but a problem for europe in its entirety .
even though the accident had largely disappeared from the media headlines prior to this anniversary , it has nevertheless caused a profound change of outlook among the people of europe .
a similar situation prevails at the slovenian nuclear plant in krsko . there are also serious safety defects there , which could have especially dire consequences since krsko is built on a fault line into the bargain .
chernobyl has not been consigned to history and cannot be dismissed with a few commemorative speeches .
it is about our present and our future .
it is the symbol of a danger with which we are confronted anew every day . the big mca is not just a chapter in history books but an ever-present threat to us all .
nuclear safety is indispensable , not only to the countries of central and eastern europe but also to all the countries of the union and the whole of europe .
madam president , i was here in parliament when the chernobyl explosion took place .
perhaps it was the appalling vista of the potential effects of that explosion that caused so many governments and individuals to run for cover ; because they simply could not contemplate it .
it is now largely through the efforts of some highly motivated ngos and some journalists that the full extent of the genetic time-bomb which was released in chernobyl that day is revealed in its full horror .
the full impact of the radioactive fall-out on human health is still being assessed , and i do not believe adequately assessed .
already we have seen a generation of children with grotesque and life-threatening malformations .
we have got a new word in our vocabulary now : the ' belarus necklace ' , applicable to a generation of children have had their throats slit from ear to ear to deal with their thyroid cancer .
we have done too little to alleviate the pain and distress of these children and their families .
many generous families and medical specialists in my own country are doing splendid work , but the scale of the disaster requires a concentrated and coordinated world-wide response .
we must provide more medical help for these victims .
i fear that the potential consequences , should the downside of the nuclear industry become more widely evident , are probably too much for some of our member states to bear .
madam president , madam commissioner , ten years on from the disaster at chernobyl we are beginning to understand its breadth and gravity .
we know the technical reasons for it today , we know that the rmvk reactor had an intrinsic design defect .
today the ukrainian government has massive problems to cope with involving incurable radiation sickness with unknown prognosis .
the terrible psychological stress on the people , largely linked to lack of information about the real risk , the forced exodus , the loss of the building stock , together represent an exorbitant economic and social cost .
certain problems of a strictly nuclear nature remain open , and the fuel still in the reactor , the sites where highly radio-active waste is buried , and the actual sarcophagus , do not instil confidence .
all these problems are our concern , naturally they are the concern of the ukraine first and foremost , but they are also our concern .
that is the thrust of the joint resolution we have presented with other parliamentary colleagues and which we naturally support .
madam president , the tenth anniversary of chernobyl is full of flowery statements and costly conferences , but when it comes to discussing concrete international aid , we are fed with lies , sweet talk and duplicity .
and this is done despite the fact that 200 reputable scientists from belarus , the russian federation and ukraine have already identified an increase in cancer , leukaemia and organic brain damage .
for belarus , the hardest-hit country , the equivalent of 31 annual budgets would be needed to establish some degree of control over the impact on man and nature .
that country cannot possibly afford to take such action .
that is why belarus is pursuing a policy of rehabilitation , has cut social welfare and has legalized resettlement , and the whole thing is supported by tacis aid , which is promoting economic development in highly irradiated areas .
as far as financial accountability is concerned , the nuclear operators could be made to bear responsibility for the risks by means of an international aid fund stocked by a risk levy on those operators .
at present - and this is the council and the commission 's message , one which is perhaps a little disappointing , but nonetheless real - we have the g7 's memorandum of understanding .
that is the basis of our approach .
clearly , we do not have the resources , at european union level , to conduct a large-scale action programme in this field .
we need an international agreement .
we have one .
perhaps some people do not like some aspects of that agreement .
perhaps other solutions , other types of action , could have been envisaged , but we all know how difficult international negotiations are .
we have this agreement , this memorandum , and we must stick to it .
beyond that , is there room for the european union to carry out more specific measures with its more modest resources ?
i believe that we could take action , for example - as mrs banotti mentioned - in the field of medical assistance .
clearly , there are a number of medical and social problems that have not yet been adequately addressed in the regions concerned , which do not possess the facilities that we have .
this is a field in which the european union could conduct an action programme .
in this area , commissioner , perhaps you could submit to us a more specific proposal for discussion at a meeting in the near future , which i hope will be more constructive .
madam president , commissioner , mr president-inoffice of the council , at this stage of the debate , i should like to begin by saying that today , the chernobyl sarcophagus is an impossible symbol .
i agree with mr desama that the memorandum of understanding is a positive initiative , which parliament must in no way try to play down .
consequently , there is a need for a substantial increase in both investment and the political will to take the necessary measures in the area of nuclear safety .
commissioner , i would urge you to respond to the pressure from parliament by bringing forward the economic proposals that it is calling for this afternoon , with a view to tackling the problem firmly .
madam president , all the motions for resolutions call for the closure of chernobyl-type reactors .
that is what has prompted me to speak today .
as chairman of the delegation for relations with estonia , latvia and lithuania , i have visited the ignalina plant on several occasions .
today , i would like to describe the situation in lithuania with regard to this plant .
it is europe 's largest power plant .
the carbon rods which control the cooling system have a remaining lifespan of possibly 8 years .
they are silting up .
there are problems with the spent fuel rods . there are no plans for how they are to be regenerated or stored .
the government in lithuania cannot come to a decision , because it is good economic business to operate this plant .
the plant management even talk about continuing , about expanding , about creating a unit 3 .
there is therefore a discrepancy between the policy agreed with lithuania on this plant , and the plant 's management .
perhaps that is where the problem lies .
it also requires a great deal of money .
i welcome the g7 memorandum , but in my view this should be a subject for more in-depth consideration by the intergovernmental conference .
it is , in fact , one of the biggest problems associated with the enlargement , etc. i also support those colleagues who regard this as a global commitment .
a common feature was everyone 's very great concern about the past 10 years and whether a similar situation could arise , and i do not think that any of us today could rule out that possibility .
that is why , over the last 10 years , we have been very concerned to find out whether we could have managed things better than we managed the events surrounding chernobyl .
there have been quite a lot of different figures put forward regarding the nature of the accident and the number of victims .
it is often the way that there are different measurements of this kind of thing .
i have based my information on who data , but it is not so much the numbers which should concern us , but rather the will to help the victims which we know there have been .
i personally regard that as a very important effort over the 10 years .
also the last comments from mr sindal regarding the situation in lithuania were instructive .
i do not , therefore , think that we have merely been talking .
i think that there has been international co-operation . i believe , also , that considerable efforts have been made .
both for ukraine and the people of ukraine , of course , not enough effort has been made , and until then there is a major task ahead of us .
thank you for the debate .
certainly we must do far more , that seems obvious : we must do far more now and we will have to do far more in the future .
let me say quite frankly that far more needs to be done in many respects , but i do not think it is possible to do everything for everyone in every case .
so it cannot be said that the states are doing nothing and it certainly cannot be said that the european union is doing nothing .
i would also like to make some detailed comments . a lot has been said about the ukraine , and we naturally extend our solidarity to the ukrainian delegation here today .
but we also need to talk about belarus , which is suffering equally serious pollution and human and social damage .
i also want to say that mrs stirbois is right - she is not in the chamber at the moment - that there are also power stations in the west which may present risks .
i hope it will be approved as a further demonstration that parliament is also determined to help on the chernobyl issue .
i have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
situation in the middle east
the next item is the statement by the council on the situation in the middle east .
the issue we now have to deal with is a very delicate , very complex and very difficult one .
the union has done everything possible and has spared no effort to try to reach , or at least facilitate , a solution to the troubles in the middle east .
but the vision has not always coincided ; sometimes it has been complementary .
as you know , many steps have been taken subsequently in the midst of great difficulty , difficulty that certainly did not result from lack of determination on the part of the presidency , the council and the commission .
the troika was able to visit certain middle eastern capitals ; in fact if i am not mistaken it is in beirut or damascus or amman or tel aviv at this very moment .
there have been some results , fewer than we would have hoped , it is true , but account has to be taken of the objective situation .
i would like to mention one as a reminder to us all : the visibility of the union at the palestinian elections last january .
the union has also made a significant commitment to the peace process , and not just this year , with support to palestine and the palestinian national government .
i think the european union , strengthened by this record , has been in a position to express its concern about what is happening in lebanon today .
the recommendation and the hope , all too obvious , is that violence will not breed violence , that chain reactions will not be triggered off and endanger the peace process .
the member states of the union regard the peace process as important because of the concrete results already achieved , and everyone is determined to do everything possible to prevent those achievements being compromised .
in summary , the objectives proposed by the council and the union are to implement united nations security council resolution 425 , urging all to exercise moderation , and above all to end military action .
all the countries involved are being asked to contribute , as far as possible , to a reduction in the level of tension and above all - i repeat - to abstain from the use of force .
ladies and gentlemen , the union - as i said at the start - reaffirms israel 's right to its own security and condemns the violence of hizbollah which has caused a reaction by israel .
but at the same time , the union expresses its concern about the effects the israeli reaction has had on the unarmed civilian population , and an emergency plan to assist the populations directly affected is being implemented .
i think this action is strengthened by what has been done over the last few years .
the italian presidency is maintaining that policy , especially by coordinating its own action with the countries of the area on the one hand , and with the united states and with egypt on the other .
there is an american delegation in rome at this very moment for that purpose .
it hardly needs sating that the attention of the council and of all the member states represented by the council is concentrated on this issue .
next monday 's general affairs council in luxembourg will definitely go further into the situation in the light of any information it has been possible to obtain .
the problem is close to all our hearts and has dramatically worsened in the last few days and hours .
madam president , i would like to thank the president-in-office for his report and we were particularly pleased to hear that the troika are at this moment active in the region .
it is important that the european council is seen to act through the troika rather than just leaving actions to individual member states of the union , no matter how worthy and welcome those individual actions may be .
it is the action of the european union that my group believes is crucial at this moment .
those of us who have vested much hope and expectation in the middle east process are today sad and despairing .
on behalf of the socialist group today we extend our undiluted support for that peace process .
we offer our support as well to the israeli labour government and those of their arab neighbours who have met the challenge of peace and have become bigger men because of it .
let us also not underestimate the immense provocation to which the israeli people have been subjected and to which their labour government has steadfastly over months urged understanding and tolerance .
what were they supposed to do in the face of unprecedented murders , terrorism and sustained attack ?
it is always more difficult to tell your friends and those you respect that you believe they are wrong .
yet today my group urges israel to stop the bombing and action in lebanon which we believe cannot be right and cannot aid a long-term solution .
rather it perpetuates hate , encourages yet more young arabs to take up arms against israel and it destabilizes israel 's friendly arab neighbours .
we condemn utterly those in lebanon who have permitted the attacks against israel to continue from lebanese territory .
we deplore the hand of iran in this and look to syria to exercise leverage in lebanon if it truly seeks peace as its leaders so recently assured a delegation from my group that it did .
the european union has a growing responsibility to support those seeking peace on its borders .
we owe it to israel and to the palestinians .
we owe it to the memory of yitzhak rabin and we owe it as well to shimon peres and to yasser arafat .
of course we want israel to stop the bombing that is causing such human misery to the civilian population in lebanon .
but we also demand solidarity and real political commitment to support israeli civilians against the terror of the extremists .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in the middle east is now extremely grave and there is a long list of victims on all sides .
in the face of this reality , sad as it is for the prospect of peace , i wish the european union had done much more than it already has .
the immediate measures have four ingredients : on the one hand , an end to terrorist acts against israel and provision of the security guarantees which that demands .
on the other hand , immediate cessation of bombardments by israel and the withdrawal of israeli forces from the security zone in south lebanon .
long-term policy amounts in essence to just one thing - the continuation and support of the peace process already started .
so far as long-term policy is concerned , in other words the peace process , there is no doubt that to continue and support this process is the only guarantee of peace in the area .
in that sector we do in fact see substantial intervention and help , at least from the commission .
yet , still more initiatives are needed and must be undertaken by the union .
i have already spoken about putting forward a range of trust-building measures to guarantee the continuation and support of the peace process .
no doubt there are other specific activities that could take place to make the most of such channels as the union has already opened , but also - and why not - to open fresh ones as well .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , a motion has been tabled which expresses the anxiety of all the political groups in this house .
on behalf of the european people 's party , i call for a vote in favour of that motion .
the first has already paid for his courageous commitment to peace with his life , and the position of the second is now being weakened by the new situation in the region .
the european union and its member states must do everything possible to prevent the logic of peace from being replaced by a logic of war , through a deadly sequence of events which no one is able to stop .
we must reaffirm unequivocally the right of the israeli people to live in peace and security within their internationally recognized and guaranteed borders .
at the same time , however , we must recognize , with equal formality and commitment , the right of the palestinian and lebanese peoples to live in peace within states whose territorial integrity and sovereignty must be recognized .
we must call on all the warring parties to show the spirit of conciliation that is needed for the continuation of the peace process .
it is hard to accept without comment the statement by the israeli prime minister that it is too early to negotiate .
it is never too early to negotiate to stop a war : to say otherwise would be to admit that a war can be justified and to exclude any kind of preventive diplomacy .
no one doubts the ability of the israeli army to destroy hizbollah - but at the cost of how many ' martyrs ' whose successors will demand vengeance ?
furthermore , there is nothing to say that this is the israeli government 's objective - for is it not syria , through poor lebanon , which is its target ?
is it therefore reasonable to call on the head of the lebanese government to disarm hizbollah , whilst continuing to occupy part of that country 's territory ?
evacuation and disarmament must go hand in hand .
today , it is the rebuilding of lebanon which is being called into question .
how many years will it take to erase from the collective mind of the peoples of the region the painful memories of the present conflict and those which have preceded it ?
the solution to the conflict will not be military , but diplomatic .
similarly , we are entitled to call on our american partner , the united states government - whose opinion , we know , counts for a great deal with the israeli government - to play a mediating role .
we welcome the ceasefire plan proposed by the united states government , but the ceasefire must be implemented without delay .
in particular , the israeli air force 's bombing raids on civilian targets in lebanon must end immediately , because as the french prime minister said yesterday , they are unacceptable .
naturally , the same goes for hizbollah 's rocket attacks on northern israel .
we can only deplore the large numbers of civilian victims of the conflict and the misery of the displaced populations .
diplomacy must now prevail over bombs and rockets .
we must pray that the peace process will be resumed and continued .
we all hoped that the murder of yitzhak rabin would not be in vain , but would serve the cause of peace and not that of war , as his assassins wished .
now is the time to remember this , whilst imploring all those responsible for the current escalation of violence to rejoin the path of negotiation and peace , for tomorrow may be too late .
madam president , israel 's current actions in south lebanon do not constitute an attack , but a response to an attack .
this is the conviction which determines the liberal group 's position , and which underlies its motion for a resolution and the fact that it does not subscribe to the joint motion for a resolution .
in the present century , democracies have not waged war with one another .
wars have always broken out between democracies and totalitarian or fanatical states , and that is what we are witnessing today .
it is for this reason that , whilst deploring the human tragedy currently being played out in the middle east , we retain the hope that the peace process will not only be resumed , but extended .
in particular , we hope that a peace treaty between israel and lebanon - the lebanon that we love - can also be signed .
madam president , the israeli bombing of lebanon provokes our condemnation and concern .
it is plunging the defenceless lebanese people into all the horrors of war - dead and wounded civilians , the destruction of property , and mass exodus .
and it is jeopardizing the entire peace process in the region , which gave rise to such hope .
clearly , we can only condemn hizbollah 's blind attacks on the israeli population .
far from contributing to its security , however , israel 's bombing can only fan the flames of fundamentalism and encourage terrorism and its monstrous outrages .
in this region , as elsewhere , the escalation of violence is a dead end. such a chain of events exposes the civilian population , which has such need of peace , to all the dangers of war .
everything possible must be done to save the peace process and build a lasting peace in the region .
the european union and each of its member states must act to bring an end to israel 's military actions and bombing in lebanon .
it must bring its full weight to bear to help the resumption of the peace process and the building of a lasting peace which guarantees the security of all the peoples of the region .
we believe that the peace process is now at risk - it must be continued .
we are happy to agree with the liberals that the peace process must be expanded to include lebanon and syria .
we demand that israel stop the bombing immediately and enter into negotiations .
the israelis must also show clearly that they are prepared to withdraw from lebanon completely as part of an agreed peaceful settlement of the conflict .
syria must use its influence to put an end to the hizbollah action .
we condemn the attitude of the iranian government and we urge the commission to draw up a comprehensive plan for humanitarian aid for those who have suffered in the israeli attacks .
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , the events of the last few days in lebanon fill us with dismay , since they are threatening the peace process which we have welcomed from the start .
certainly , we can and must understand the reaction of the israeli government , which cannot stand back and watch while terrorist attacks increase and its citizens are killed .
we can also understand the difficulties of prime minister peres , who is facing elections and is obliged to demonstrate his firmness .
and we can express our concern that israel 's response is a disproportionate one , all the more so in that it is impossible to see how the crisis can be resolved by force .
ultimately , the outcome of hamas and hizbollah 's appalling attacks and israel 's ' grapes of wrath ' retaliatory operation is a spiral of violence which is in danger of becoming out of control .
as for the international diplomatic initiatives , they are hardly likely to reassure us .
firstly , i would comment on the almost total absence of the european union , which once again has been overtaken by events .
furthermore , israel will only talk to the united states , and seems to think that it is the only possible mediator .
the united states ' peace plan has finally been examined by the opposing governments .
france , for its part , has attempted a number of measures , but without consulting the other member states beforehand - which is hardly in keeping with the european spirit .
neither israel nor the united states make this mistaken assumption .
in the face of this mess , however , let us hope that the meeting next friday between shimon peres and yasser arafat will enable the region to emerge from this nightmare .
madam president , after the suicide attacks by the hamas the rocket assaults on northern israel by the shiite hizbollah movement show clearly how fragile the peace process is in the middle east .
the freedom that syria and in its wake lebanon are giving to the actions of the hizbollah is a major obstacle to reaching a definitive peace settlement .
it is unacceptable that this movement is allowed to wage such acts of aggression from lebanese soil .
one basic principle of international law is that no country may make its territory available for enemy activities against another country .
the israeli government is justified in its military actions of the last few days to do everything possible to protect its citizens on the border with lebanon against the cowardly rocket attacks .
as diplomatic means had no chance of success they had no option other than this to defend themselves .
in the meantime israel 's actions are a clear warning to syria and lebanon to put a complete stop to the hizbollah 's activities on lebanese territory .
they have sufficient means if only they have the political determination to do so .
i would therefore urge both the council and the commission to stress action against the hizbollah in their contacts with both countries .
the independence of the lebanese state must also be re-established by syria and iran ending their interference in lebanon .
finally developments in lebanon form an additional reason to exert diplomatic pressure on iran .
iran is an important source of support and inspiration for the hizbollah movement .
a signal from the european union , as well as one from israel , would not be out of place to show iran clearly that sabotaging the peace process is not worthwhile .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , once again , lebanon is being battered and bruised in a war which the two rival powers in the region are waging on its territory .
syria arms the hizbollah militias in their war - which it firmly controls - against israel .
hizbollah was created by and for syria .
given that the israelis know and declare that the syrian authorities are behind hizbollah , therefore , why do they not hit damascus - for that is where the movement 's leaders live ?
its arms dumps , barracks and training camps are all in syria .
the truth is plain to see .
israel and syria have a cynical , immoral and dishonourable pact to keep the war in lebanon , and the latest incidents are just an episode in this situation .
it is to syria 's advantage .
the war legitimizes its police and military regime and its occupation of lebanon .
and it is to israel 's advantage .
an economically prosperous lebanon would mean the return of beirut as a strong financial centre , at the expense of haifa and tel aviv .
so israel 's army destroys the power stations and the painstakingly rebuilt infrastructure in christian territory in lebanon .
consequently , this pact suits both the israeli government - which is backed unconditionally by the united states - and , since the gulf war , syria 's dictators .
meanwhile , no one cares if little children in iraq and lebanon are dying .
for them , there are no human rights !
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should not like to miss this opportunity to thank the presidency for their kind and helpful comments .
it was particularly valuable to learn that the union had sent observers to the elections in palestine .
from time to time you tell us , mr president-in-office , what the troika has been doing and what has been happening with the american delegation in rome .
now , in the light of your comments , i can better understand why the french government chose to go it alone .
i wish to begin with the common ground that has characterized the middle east policy of the european parliament for many years .
first of all , the european parliament has unequivocally and emphatically condemned every act of terrorism , including today 's katyusha rocket attacks on northern israel by the hizbollah .
secondly , irrespective of party and national allegiance , we in the european parliament have welcomed and supported the peace process between israel and the plo .
today i know that only the peace process , not military action , can achieve this . '
mr rabin , as a former hawk , was more able than anyone to convince people that there is only one way to solve the israel-palestine problem .
his conviction and his commitment to peace cost him his life .
deaths , misery , expulsion and suffering are on our agenda today .
that is why this parliament , which has spoken such clear words in the past , must turn to israel today and tell it to stop the bombing and the expulsions in lebanon right now !
we were pleased and delighted when the peace process started and the agreement was reached .
today i have heard talk from many people on the floor of this house about war .
i hope it is not war .
i hope it is an act of terrorism that we are seeing and that we can actually get back to the peace process and the continuation of the agreement .
terrorism stops the peace process and i believe that some people have a lot to answer for at the present time , namely hamas and hizbollah .
of course syria is involved , and , of course , syria must be a key player in the eventual solution .
we as a community must act together and i am delighted to hear the president-inoffice say that the troika is currently looking at the situation .
i hope that just looking at the situation actually produces some results , because we must get a solution !
we cannot , as a community , keep depending on the united states to solve all the problems in the world , and that is what it currently looks like .
we must get up a little bit earlier , as president clinton has advised us .
but we must also understand the israeli response to the current situation .
i am convinced , having been to israel a couple of times recently , that they seek and desire peace .
in the negotiations and in the agreement they have already given up a lot .
they have given much towards the peace process and yet we are not seeing the peace process being delivered from the other side .
i do not myself feel inclined , therefore , to condemn outright the israeli response to what is happening at the present time .
when they were under attack , when their citizens were being killed , it was not easy for them .
we must look at the whole situation .
there is one government in the middle east which is guilty of crimes within its own country as well as within the middle east generally and that , of course , is iran .
we need concerted action from the community , we need coordinated action , and i hope that the troika can deliver it .
mr president , this parliament has expressed on numerous occasions its unequivocal support for the middle east peace process initiated by the oslo agreements .
with equal firmness , it has condemned the terrorist attacks which directly threaten that process by sustaining a familiar strategy of raising tension .
it has also said , though , that combating terrorism effectively means bringing an end to the conditions which provide its breedingground .
rather , they will be eliminated by strictly complying with the commitments made to the palestinian national authority .
similarly , the israeli army 's disproportionate attacks against lebanon will not succeed in stopping hizbollah 's bombardment of israeli civilians .
moreover , those attacks are causing numerous civilian casualties , including children .
and , above all , they are seriously undermining the stability which the region desperately needs , as well as the peace process as a whole .
israel must cease its military actions against lebanon and comply with the relevant international resolutions , in particular un security council resolutions 425 , 508 and 509 , which call for its withdrawal from south lebanon .
it is not possible for such serious action to be taken purely on the basis of electoral considerations - unless the fact is that the hawks in the israeli army are daily gaining ground in tel aviv .
if israel complies with those international resolutions , hizbollah and its sponsors will be isolated and deprived of all justification for their actions .
association agreements , mr president , must be made conditional on compliance with international resolutions and the non-use of military means to resolve problems .
mr president , all reasonable people know that no problem can ever be solved by war , in the middle east or anywhere else .
and no one can remain indifferent to the suffering of civilian populations , in lebanon or elsewhere .
the terrorist movements responsible for these actions , these murders , have been clearly identified .
they have the backing and financial support of a terrorist state - iran - and operate from lebanon , a country which is largely under the military control of syria .
these terrorist movements must therefore be eradicated once and for all . to this end , iran must be ostracized by europe , and syria must be forced to the negotiating table .
mr president , once again , the middle east has been the scene of tragic events .
should we really be surprised ?
the considerable progress on the road to peace made over the last few years led us to believe that the conditions for a stable and lasting solution had finally been met .
in reality , fundamental problems , providing the implacable enemies of peace with forceful arguments , still remain .
israel 's occupation of south lebanon and the inability of the lebanese government to guarantee the region 's security are fundamental obstacles to achieving peace .
there can be no successful solution without the intervention of mediating powers .
france was the first to take diplomatic and humanitarian action .
the united states has involved itself by tabling a plan for settling the conflict , which unfortunately - if my information is correct - has just been rejected by hizbollah .
we must not pay heed to a simplistic view of competition between the united states and france , or the idea that the intervention of two states will complicate rather than facilitate the settlement of the problem .
strictly speaking , france and the united states do not have the same position on the middle east .
their approach to the individual states in the region is different .
for this very reason , their respective actions , if coordinated , could greatly help to bring about a permanent solution .
with regard to europe - or , more precisely , european political cooperation - as ever , it has been somewhat slow off the mark .
europe 's institutions are more at issue here than the men and women who run them .
will the negotiators at the intergovernmental conference remember this , in the pale light of dawn that always surrounds the final hours of treaty negotiations ?
mr president , i also want to address my remarks directly to the president-in-office of the council , mr ferraris , to call for a more visible initiative by the european union .
mr president , i should firstly like to say that i agree with many of the major points that mrs green and mr sakellariou have made about this conflict .
i shall therefore take this opportunity to make a number of other points , which may be minor ones , but which i believe need to be highlighted .
i had the opportunity to attend the palestinian elections as an observer for the european parliament .
today , yasser arafat 's government and people are fighting terrorism .
and i heard a short while ago , at a meeting held in this very building , that the israeli ambassador recognizes and welcomes this fact .
and i think it is clear that no one in this chamber wishes to see a return to the logic of violence either .
the european union has established , albeit timidly , a framework for dialogue .
it persuaded the syrians and israelis to sit down at the same table at the barcelona conference .
it played a fundamental role in the palestinian elections .
i am afraid , however , that those who put arms into the hand of the israeli prime minister 's assassin are in the end starting to influence and determine israel 's policy and the dynamics of its position .
because everyone recognizes the right to self defence , but it is a right that must be exercised with complete and strict self restraint .
here , we now have aggressive action on the part of the israeli government , we have barbarous , foolish and dangerous acts .
and from that standpoint i think those acts should be condemned by the european union , the united states , and by every international agency .
i was in beirut last week on the day that the israeli actions started .
it struck me in the airport that every hall had a portrait of the syrian president hafez al-assad and his dead son .
it is quite clear that syria is calling the shots in lebanon .
mr president , the hizbollah 's actions from lebanon can only , and i really mean only , be carried out with the approval and collaboration of syria .
then there would be no reason for israel to take action outside its own frontiers .
has the time not come for a real eu policy , for example on arms supplies ?
finally , mr president , did france take action after eu consultation or did they go it alone ?
and what do they hope to achieve in view of the american efforts ?
mr president , in the path of justice is life , says the bible in chapter 12 of the book of proverbs .
that is the motto of next year 's congress of the protestant church in germany .
without justice there is no life and no peace .
i urge the hizbollah and their backers to stop firing on northern israel , to call a halt to terrorism and to accept the offer of negotiations .
we want to amend point 5 of the resolution , which i believe would make it acceptable .
we europeans believe in the peace process that mr rabin initiated , and we shall do everything in our power to ensure the success of that process .
mr president , at the same time the commission is convinced that first of all an end must be put to terrorism .
mr president , i agree with the feeling in this house that does not wish to polemicise .
this is about maintaining the peace process and the peace process is today at stake .
but there is a difference between taking action precisely to save the peace process or taking terrorist action to torpedo it .
i feel that this distinction must be clearly made .
there is a necessary and objective process of joint planning which can be an advantage but may also , as in this case , be a disadvantage of the european union .
in fact the troika went to teheran on 2 april , that is , after sharm-el-sheikh and before the current crisis .
all this must be considered when intervention is described as too slow - although that is true , there is no denying it .
i would like to make two or three more points .
this is , i repeat , an extremely delicate issue , and if it is to be handled successfully i do not think everything can be made public . sometimes matters have to be discussed with extreme caution .
the objective is to involve everyone in a peace process , every zone in the area , every country and every effort they can make towards it .
today , at this very moment , american under-secretary peltow is in rome to try to coordinate joint action with the presidency in the hope that this can have some effect .
and here i would like to remind you that on the 29th the follow-up to sharm-el-sheikh will be held in luxembourg in a community setting .
in addition to this , other ideas have been outlined and the american under-secretary is examining them today in rome .
at the moment the troika delegation is in cairo , tomorrow it will be in damascus , and the day after tomorrow in tel aviv .
some things are still in the pipeline so i cannot go into as much detail as i would like .
but i want to assure parliament and honourable members that all of us , the council , the presidency , the member states , quite clearly regard this as an issue of the greatest importance .
mr alavanos is right that it is in fact of special interest to italy , for obvious reasons it seems to me , but unfortunately italy is not acting alone and there are many things to be considered .
i have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow .
question time ( council )
the next item is question time to the council ( b4-0431 / 96 ) .
i regret that we are down to one hour rather than the usual one and a half hours .
therefore , i shall allow a supplementary question from the original questioner plus one other rather than the usual two .
mr president , you have said the we have just one hour .
it is scandalous that it is reduced that way .
in fact we have only 48 minutes .
i beg you to present something to the presidency .
it is intolerable that one of the major rights of parliament - to ask questions - is not being fulfilled .
it really is intolerable , what is happening now .
mr von habsburg , i am totally in agreement with you .
i constantly bring this matter up both in writing to the president and to the heads of the political groups .
i do not seem to be making much progress but perhaps together we can have another go .
i intend to have one hour of questions even though this goes beyond 7 p.m. i hope that the interpreters will be agreeable to this because it always depends on their cooperation .
mr ferraris , thank you very much for your answer which proves yet once more that italians may perhaps think more in symbols and dutch probably more in effective measures .
this coordination centre was to have a direct link with the european institutions to facilitate adequate political action .
i did this in conjunction with all international and national journalists ' organisations , and i am now asking you why i have not to date even received an acknowledgment of receipt .
i trust you will do something about that .
question no 2 by concepci&oacute; ferrer ( h-0211 / 96 )
subject : plan for joint action to combat racism and xenophobia
given the fundamental differences between the uk and the other member states regarding the plan for joint action to strengthen judicial cooperation in the area of combating racism ,
does the council intend to maintain the broad thrust of the initial plan ?
does it not believe that the objectives of the proposed action would be difficult to achieve if the british position were to prevail ?
the text we proposed takes account of certain comments made by the united kingdom delegation in particular and is broadly based on the plan examined by the council in november 1995 .
this text is intended to establish legal cooperation on the instructions for drafting the leaflet on conduct that can be described as racist or xenophobic .
the purpose of this cooperation is to ensure that such conduct is subject to criminal sanctions or covered by exemptions under the principle of double jeopardy .
for its part , the italian presidency will do everything possible to ensure that this plan can be approved before our presidency ends .
it goes without saying that we consider it the duty of every free citizen to condemn racism and xenophobia .
thank you , mr president-in-office , for your answer to my question , which was in fact tabled before the council adopted its decision .
let us not forget that racism and xenophobia are a great problem , which requires action on the scale of that which the council and , more specifically , the italian presidency are in favour of taking .
consequently , i simply wish to thank you for your answer and welcome the proposed action .
i would like to congratulate the italian presidency on the way it has promoted this issue of taking action to combat racism and xenophobia at the european level as well as at local and national level .
i am dismayed at the negative attitude of my own government .
will the council make every effort to try and persuade the british government that we need to take action at the european level as well as anything else we do ?
could i also ask the president-in-office if the final decision on action in this area will be taken by unanimity or by a qualified majority ?
this time the honourable member has me in difficulties , because i do not know the answer .
i say that sincerely .
i venture to suggest that a decision like this , condemning racism and xenophobia , would be unanimous .
it would be surprising if the fifteen were not unanimous on this subject .
ladies and gentlemen , our condemnation of racism and xenophobia cannot be limited to legislation to prevent it .
there is a need to promote moral action , because if the european parliament and the european union are not in a position to combat racism and xenophobia , they will be failing in one of their duties .
question no 3 by alexandros alavanos ( h-0213 / 96 )
subject : position of the council regarding the crisis between greece and turkey
at its meeting of 26 february 1996 the council was also unable to adopt a position because the united kingdom exercised its right of veto .
does the council consider that such a position is conducive to the idea of a common foreign and security policy ?
mr alavanos ' question is also quite difficult and delicate at this time .
a little while ago mr alavanos quite rightly spoke about the importance of equilibrium in the mediterranean . he was referring to the middle east and also recalling the difficulties between greece and turkey .
i thank mr ferraris and in every way echo the wishes he has expressed .
and i now want to make my question completely specific on the basis of recent developments , namely the failure to convene the council of association .
i ask for a specific answer from the president-in-office .
mr alavanos is right in a sense , but if it were possible to give a more definite reply , the problem would already have been solved .
the difficulty actually lies in trying to identify the possibility of genuine terms for a solution between the two parties involved .
question no 4 by carmen fraga est&eacute;vez ( h-0225 / 96 )
subject : decision by the us court of international trade
does the council not agree that there is a need to ban the use of such fisheries equipment in the mediterranean as soon as possible , in order to avoid a trade war with the united states ?
i do not think that would be correct . in general we believe that our community legislation conforms to united nations resolutions .
in fact the council has never had occasion up to now to discuss the specific facts mentioned in the question , so i do not think there is any more i can say in answer to mrs fraga est&eacute;vez .
i am grateful to the president-in-office for his explanation , but i am obliged to say that the council has been examining the commission proposal and parliament 's report for almost two years now .
it is therefore taking its time .
i hope that it reaches a successful conclusion .
furthermore , i should like to ask the president-in-office a question . the decision by the united states court of international trade is following an unstoppable course .
in principle , there was a deadline of 8 april , by which date the us government was required to ask the italian government to submit an action plan for controlling the use of driftnets in the mediterranean .
given that the italian government has 30 days in which to reply , therefore , is the italian government prepared to submit such an action plan ?
and if so , what guideline measures will it contain ?
i would like to make two comments . the first is a general one on your complaint about the delays , mrs fraga est&eacute;vez .
i was very surprised by the reply from the presidentin-office .
he said that the council was not in the habit of commenting on the decisions of organizations other than itself .
if it decides to take no action , that will mean that it accepts the accusations .
in that case , it must resolve to put the community 's house in order .
if it decides to take action , because it believes that the united states has violated world trade rules , then it will have to take the matter to the world trade organization .
my question is : does the council intend to defend the community 's fisheries exports by lodging a complaint against the united states with the world trade organization ?
or does it , on the contrary , intend to accept the export ban ?
if that is the case , it will have to draw up a policy to ensure compliance with united nations rules in the fisheries sector .
question no 5 by michl ebner ( h-0233 / 96 )
subject : protection of minorities in member states of the union
i do not think it will be difficult for mr ebner to understand my thinking on the subject of what has been done by the council and by italy on the principle of respect for minority nationalities .
certainly nothing is said about this in the maastricht treaty - there mr ebner is right - there is no explicit mention , in fact , except in the general area of the defence of human rights .
count ferraris , i am sincerely grateful both for what you have said and above all for what has been done in the past on this issue .
that is a great pity , and i believe that the demand made by the european parliament in the maij-weggen / dury report underlines this .
i think i can also say on behalf of the council that this is non-discrimination : but that would be a long debate and i do not want to go into detail .
i would like to suggest that parliament returns to this issue . it is true it was not mentioned , but that was for the sake of brevity , not out of ill will .
i think point 4.13 of parliament 's resolution on europe 's support for the recognition of cultural diversity ought to be taken up .
mr president-in-office , your answers have been excellent , but i am afraid the same cannot be said of the situation itself .
if we added all of the national minorities or ethnic groups in the european union together , particularly after enlargement , they would constitute the second-largest member state .
this , then , is a very sizeable problem .
at the moment , the preamble to the europe agreements contains an obligation to protect minorities .
when these states accede to the union , however , this obligation will cease to apply .
the intergovernmental conference , of course , has a mandate to prepare the community for enlargement , and i cannot imagine how the community can be enlarged without an internal mechanism for the protection of minorities .
otherwise many problems from central and eastern europe will be imported into the european union .
i have difficulty answering you , mr posselt , because i have already mentioned the importance of this issue in relation to the enlargement myself .
let me repeat that we are at the start of an intergovernmental conference .
i entirely agree with you that it is an issue we need to resolve internally , before the enlargement produces further problems .
furthermore , speaking as an italian - i think mr ebner gave me credit for this - i believe we have done everything possible .
problems will never be entirely solved ; total satisfaction will never be possible !
otherwise we would not be human , we would be divine .
question no 6 by christine oddy ( h-0247 / 96 )
what steps does the council intend to take to ensure that urgently required medical aid is sent to northern sri lanka ?
i think i have already replied in the past to questions about sri lanka and my reply to ms oddy is that the european union is very concerned .
i have the impression , alas , that the union does not have great resources .
i can only hope that the parties will return to the negotiating table , but in situations of this kind it is fairly rare .
both sides must be willing to negotiate and this does not seem to me to be the case in very tragic conflict situations like the one in sri lanka .
i visited sri lanka from 1-5 april and met joe green , the commission representative out there , who was very helpful .
he is under-resourced and this is bringing the european union into disrepute at present .
there are three problems which i have now identified and i would like the council 's views on them .
firstly , a number of important supplies , such as medicine , which could help the ltte , are banned from the north .
this affects children , elderly people and the disabled .
can the council use its good offices to ensure that civilians do not suffer from lack of medical assistance ?
secondly , there is a drought in the country and it is feared that there could be a severe shortage of food in a few months ' time .
again , will the council comment on emergency preparations in place if that should transpire ?
thirdly , there is a problem of lack of independent , objective assessment of the situation and suffering of civilians in the north .
will the council try to ensure that the echo office visits as soon as possible ?
you are right , ms oddy .
i can see that you probably know better than anyone that sri lanka recently reintroduced a state of emergency .
it is my opinion , finally , that the union , the presidency and the council are unfortunately powerless in the face of this tragic situation .
question no 7 by mar&iacute;a izquierdo rojo ( h-0252 / 96 )
subject : blocking of the meda regulation by one of the 15 member states
what action will the council take to break the deadlock affecting the adoption of the meda regulation ?
but there have been repercussions from the difficulties that arose between greece and turkey , and that has slowed down and hindered the adoption of meda , which should have taken place at the general affairs council last month .
thank you , mr president-in-office , for your reply , which nevertheless directly contradicts what the european public has been told .
the answer you have just given me is new and contradictory , and is only comprehensible because of the lack of transparency in the debates of the council .
the member state which is blocking the regulation - the united kingdom - has still not given an explanation .
mr president-in-office , could you please convey the fact to the uk government that we are demanding an explanation for its obstructive stance , which is a gratuitous one that is holding up all the mediterranean programmes ?
we want a clear and public explanation .
the position defended by the united kingdom is more lax and less demanding of respect for human rights , and also has no real foundation - and i repeat this because the information is conflicting .
it is prejudicing the mediterranean region , and in my view is based on an attempt to oppose the mediterranean and the east in a way which has already been overtaken by events .
we demand an explanation .
i can give you the answers you want right away , mrs izquierdo .
i am afraid your information was not correct because the problem that existed with the united kingdom has been resolved . i am sorry to contradict you , but it has been resolved .
an accommodation was reached through the good offices of the presidency , and as a result there is now political agreement between all the member states .
question no 8 by per gahrton ( h-0255 / 96 )
subject : openness and forms of decision-making during the intergovernmental conference
at what sort of meetings are decisions taken ?
how are decisions taken , by consensus or formal voting ?
are minutes of the decision-making process kept ?
how are the documents drawn up for and connected with the various meetings handled ?
which documents are publicly accessible ?
which documents can only be made available to relevant bodies within the european parliament ?
which documents will be classified as secret ?
i think the solution adopted takes account of two aspects .
we hope that the outcome of the intergovernmental conference will be advantageous to europe and that these assumptions will be respected .
this is not a question of the european parliament 's participation in the intergovernmental conference .
it is a question of public access for citizens and journalists to the documents on which discussions and decisions at the igc are based .
it is a question of whether minutes are kept and whether those minutes are publicly accessible .
it is a question of how decisions are taken , that is to say whether this is done on the basis of a vote or of consensus , and whether unanimity is required or some form of qualified majority .
i did not unfortunately receive an answer to this question .
this conference stands alone , whatever level it develops at ; it is sovereign and it is therefore perfectly free to choose the working methods it considers most appropriate .
the intergovernmental conference must be a conference that is addressed to the citizens and open to the citizens .
i am not prepared to take that supplementary , because it referred to the previous question .
question no 9 by peter crampton ( h-0261 / 96 )
however , this will apparently not allow these citizens to enter germany , france , spain and portugal , as visa rules have not yet been harmonized at european level .
could the council explain the steps it is taking to allow british national overseas dependent territories passport holders free movement in the european union ?
the member states will have this power until the council has completed the relevant harmonization .
i would ask the council to speed up the process . i thank it for what it has done on visas but this is something that needs rather more speedy attention .
the methods for issuing this new hong kong special administrative region document have not yet been established , but it should be a different passport from that issued by the chinese government .
but if the information is wrong , the presidency will be very pleased to receive clarification and further details from you .
that concludes question time .
( the sitting was closed at 7.10 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
at the conference of presidents last week it was agreed that the statement would be made , to be followed by 30 minutes of questions without a speaking list .
anybody who looks at the agenda as published will see that it says quite clearly ' statement by the commission on bse , ...
followed by 30 minutes of questions ' .
in the allocation of speaking time it says : ' 3 to 6 p.m. , 9 to 12 midnight , excluding the commission statement on bse ' .
we are notified this afternoon that this procedure has been changed and that speaking lists have been submitted and been requested by other groups .
that is absolutely unacceptable .
i do not know who has changed it . the agreement in the conference of presidents was clear .
i would like to insist now that we revert to what the agenda clearly says was the procedure to be adopted and that we should have a free 30-minute question time following the statement from commissioner fischler .
i think we should first of all deal with the agenda , that is , the first item on the agenda .
as soon as that subject has been dealt with i shall ask the assembly , which is sovereign , whether or not it wishes to accept mrs green 's proposal .
i think that is the proper procedure to follow .
mr president , i have to say that is manipulation of the worst sort .
it is perfectly acceptable for you to make that decision now , given the time of day that it is , given the fact that my group has prepared for this discussion tonight without a speaking list .
you are now saying that we should stay here and wait until this first debate is finished before that decision is made .
that is not acceptable , mr president .
in the spirit of good will and the way this parliament operates , we could take that decision now .
there is no reason why we should not .
i ask you to take the decision now , mr president !
i think it is possible to decide now too , but to stick to the agenda which has been laid down .
first we deal with the subject which was on the agenda and then , as the second subject , under the procedure laid down by parliament , the other matter will have to be dealt with .
( the president cut the speaker off )
we shall decide quickly the procedure on the list of speakers , but the discussion on this matter must follow the order laid down by parliament and its services .
is that agreed ?
mr president , our group is under the same understanding as mrs green .
i am saying that we should decide quickly whether the speakers are to be called upon on the basis of a list or on an impromptu basis .
in any case as there is another item first we cannot upset the agenda .
so let us follow the normal procedure .
mr president , i agree with mrs green , as my colleagues no doubt do as well .
i would ask , however , that questions should not extend beyond two minutes , to ensure that the maximum possible number of members are given the chance of putting a question .
one minute would be even better .
the agenda cannot be amended , amongst other things because rule 96 of the rules of procedure says clearly that once adopted the agenda may not be amended .
( parliament agreed to the proposal )
mr president , i thank you very much for your cooperation .
as you will be in the chair , i am sure it will be an extremely good session .
it always has been !
the rules of procedure themselves do not provide for a list , but there has always been fair play on the part of the members in presenting it .
you are therefore fully entitled to make your request .
mr president , i have a further point of order .
there has seldom been a discussion for which it has been so important to have the commissioner responsible present in the house .
could you please ascertain , at the start of our discussion of the item on bse , why mr fischler is not present ?
we need him to give us a clear statement .
i do not wish to imply any lack of respect for his deputies , but we do need a clear and unambiguous statement from mr fischler himself .
i must say that it is not necessary for the commissioner to be here , because we are dealing with another matter .
let us proceed calmly and with due order !
visby summit
the next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
mr president , the baltic region has been a region without common hope for the future , with an iron curtain on land and out at sea .
now , however , the region is busy developing the same flourishing cooperation which brought the region as a whole considerable prosperity before the communist takeover .
the council of baltic sea states can play an important role here and the european union 's involvement is of considerable importance too .
four of the countries in the council of baltic sea states are members of the european union .
four countries - poland and the three baltic republics - have europe agreements and have applied for full membership .
the other countries in the council of baltic sea states , among which russia should receive special mention , have agreements with the eu on more or less long-term cooperation .
the baltic region is the eu 's nordic dimension .
the commission is itself a member of the council of baltic sea states .
though cooperation in the region is promising , there are still threats and challenges : the european union has a land border with russia in the north .
the kaliningrad region is surrounded by countries which have applied for membership of the union .
economic zones meet out in the baltic sea .
the situation as regards security policy is unstable because the political future of russia is so uncertain .
security policy is not on the agenda for visby but these issues will dominate cooperation .
the foundations for peaceful development must be laid through dialogue and constructive cooperation at all levels .
the council of baltic sea states is of particular significance precisely because russia is one of its members .
considerable attention will be paid to environmental issues and this is necessary in view of the environmental destruction wrought by ruthless exploitation by the soviet union .
there will also be discussion of how cooperation can best be used to further more democratic and politically stable societies , where there is respect and legal security .
the battle against organised crime is on the agenda .
the greatest opportunities for further cooperation lie in the economic field .
shortly before visby a meeting will be held in stockholm with prominent business leaders from all the countries in the baltic region ; at the meeting a special declaration is to be adopted .
the baltic states and poland must make considerable efforts of their own to reform their economies and political systems with the aim of acceding to the union .
the commission and the council of ministers must provide special assistance with this .
the accession negotiations must then be conducted speedily .
during the negotiations with the countries which are seeking membership of the eu there will be many who point out the budgetary costs of enlarging the union .
there must be no misunderstanding , however .
the european union was established to promote peace and freedom and to foster prosperity through economic liberalisation and political cooperation .
european cooperation has not been achieved in order for europe to paralyse itself as a result of expensive agricultural support .
prospective members are not primarily interested in subsidies but in economic freedom and political cooperation .
in this they are driven by the same motives as the founding fathers of european cooperation .
the union is now in a position to complete its historic mission .
the eu has every reason to support regional cooperation around the baltic sea economically and politically .
greater baltic cooperation will facilitate a rapid enlargement of the european union to include estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland .
baltic cooperation also demonstrates how cooperation between eu countries and countries outside the union , such as norway , iceland and russia , can be put into practice on the basis of trust .
by ensuring that the baltic conference is a success the eu can also wash away the unjust images of the eu as an exclusive club for western europe alone .
i believe that the europe agreements on trade between the eu and applicant countries should be reviewed so that they do more to promote trade and enterprise around the baltic .
the baltic region should once again be able to become a flourishing region for trade , investment and tourism .
vigorous economic action is required from the eu for the environmental clean-up of discharge sources and to improve the marine environment of the baltic .
the eu 's support system can definitely be used better to ensure the sustainable development of the baltic sea region .
the european parliament has shown great interest in baltic cooperation and issues concerning the baltic have been debated here on many occasions .
we should have had the opportunity to participate in a dialogue on these issues sooner .
mr president , the baltic sea area is turning into a northern extension of the european union stretching far towards the arctic ocean .
all 11 states in the area are either members of the european union or are linked to it by special agreements .
the european union is also a full member of the area 's central cooperation bodies , particularly the baltic council and the baltic protection commission ( helcom ) .
at present , economic support targeted at the baltic area is still only weakly coordinated in the union .
the greens in the european parliament call for the commission to develop an integrated baltic programme .
it need not think that it would have to start building up such a programme from scratch , for cooperation has been established in the area for a long time and is indeed based on a centuries-old tradition .
the region 's own expertise and existing development programmes should be exploited and an attempt made to coordinate them .
close cooperation particularly in the framework of the baltic council is now important because this body might become the region 's most important political coordinator .
the baltic region also needs to build up a comprehensive environment programme on the basis of sustainable development .
helcom has an operational programme currently in force and this could certainly be used as a basis for a more ambitious plan than in the past .
the commission 's task is above all to ensure that it has sufficient international funding .
the commission is due to assume the presidency of helcom at the beginning of july and this will provide an excellent opportunity , nay , an obligation , to carry out this task .
in the plan for large-scale transport and energy networks a wide-ranging strategic environmental impact assessment must be carried out , because the baltic 's sensitive environment cannot cope with these projects .
a very critical attitude needs to be taken to them and an attempt must be made to support environmentally acceptable solutions .
the region has considerable energy resources , even though it also has major problems .
priority in energy policy should be given to natural gas networks ; the most dangerous nuclear power stations should be closed immediately and it must above all be remembered that there are measurable nuclear problems in the kola peninsula .
the commission ought to say how it sees the possible enlargement of nato and the western european union affecting the stability of the baltic sea area .
in this new initiative which the commission has proposed , all the various points of view , from environmental policy to security issues and economic development , should be brought together .
mr president , the initiative adopted by the commission to reinforce the stability and economic development of the baltic sea area is welcome .
the commission is not offering any new resources , but is proposing a better exploitation of current cooperation and programmes .
there are good reasons for starting from this point : established forms of cooperation must be fully exploited .
the commission proposal contains concrete projects in the energy field .
it notes that the crude oil pipeline from russia to finland , together with the linking of the eu 's and the associated countries ' electricity and gas networks , should be a subject of development .
by way of example , the commission mentions the baltic electricity ring which was adopted at parliament 's suggestion as one of the list of energy networks in the community interest .
the commission 's new initiative will only be sufficiently comprehensive if it also includes a concrete opinion on the development of the gas network .
simply having a positive attitude to this issue is not sufficient .
the development of the northern european gas network received the support of the european parliament and council conciliation committee .
interinstitutional declarations stress that the development of gas networks in northern europe creates possibilities for significant growth in gas markets and for the improvement of energy security and environmental quality throughout the union .
in conciliation on energy networks parliament 's proposal for a northern gas network - the nordic gas grid project - was unfortunately omitted from the project list .
i should therefore like to propose , in paragraph 7 of the resolution due to be adopted tomorrow , a wording which reflects the current state of the project .
in amendment no 6 i propose that the nordic gas grid project be included as soon as possible on the list of europe-wide projects in the common interest .
mr president , the group of the european radical alliance supports the resolution on the forthcoming summit on the baltic sea , for reasons which i shall outline briefly .
the countries bordering the baltic differ from each other and in their relations with the european union .
it is heartening that the baltic sea summit should provide a forum where these countries can forget their differences in order to launch new initiatives for working together .
mr president , when governments and heads of state meet in the baltic council , it must be presumed that this is to emphasise a desire for action and to underscore its high priority .
parliament has , on several occasions , pointed out the need to bring about practical baltic cooperation .
new member states , more applicant countries , everything already points in the same direction , as other colleagues have stressed .
it is necessary to stimulate regional cooperation .
the historical changes alone require this .
the differences are not really that great as yet .
the summit meeting , as we call it , followed by an actual baltic council meeting , should end with a declaration of intent to establish an actual baltic programme in line with the mediterranean programme .
the experience gained from our baltic inter-parliamentary delegations should provide parliament with a basis to support such a development .
it is exceptionally important that , for example , environment , transport , various networks and joint exploitation of the baltic 's resources are discussed and planned in a common baltic spirit .
in that way the region 's identity as an independent but very active part of europe is strengthened .
the council and the commission must follow up the visby meeting and ensure that hope , strength and faith in the future is given to the peoples around the baltic sea .
i would like to begin by saying that i have a lot of sympathy for the amendments tabled by mrs hautala and mrs stenius-kaukonen , but the principal matter is the joint motion for a resolution .
these peaceful neighbourly relations have formed the basis for the international cooperation which has developed in the baltic region , particularly as a result of the helsinki conventions and the helcom cooperation on the baltic 's marine environment .
it is not perfect , but it works without any supranational suprstructure .
but now it is going to end , according to the joint motion for a resolution , for the eu 's federalists demand that this regional cooperation , this international co-operation , be subordinated to the european union .
this is shown most clearly by a number of provisions .
the english version thus refers to the northern dimension of the european union .
that is the point of departure , the northern dimension of the european union is nothing other than a kind of imperialism , since there are only four member states among the many states which comprise the baltic region .
but , ladies and gentlemen - to speak on behalf of the peoples in the region - the baltic nations are quite forthright in their views : hands off baltic cooperation !
i should be tempted to discuss with mr krarup whether or not there have been wars in the baltic region , but that is not the subject this evening .
at that time the ministers approved the accession of finland and sweden to the union and the conclusion of agreements with estonia , latvia and lithuania .
moreover the danzig declaration referred to the cross-frontier dimension and the possible forms of financial aid in the framework of the phare and tacis programmes .
i wanted to quote the danzig declaration in the trust and conviction that at visby too there would be the same approval of that link , that relationship between the european union and the council of the baltic countries .
i should like to point out that the union supports regional cooperation initiatives in europe .
supporting them is , i would say , almost a union policy .
as far as we understand , this commission proposal will be ready this month , april .
in any case , commissioner van den broek will be able to tell you much more .
in addition our interest in the baltic region extends , albeit indirectly , to the central european initiative , of which poland has been an important member almost from the outset .
thus the initiative , from being four-sided , became hexagonal simply because poland was involved .
finally the political dialogue between the european union and the european economic area - norway , iceland and liechtenstein - involves countries which are more or less in the baltic area .
a meeting at ministerial level is also being considered to give it greater moment .
those were not just formal engagements , however important those may be , and i would remind you that the foreign ministers of those countries had been invited to turin together with those of the other applicant countries .
in conclusion , i have taken note of everything that has been said , in particular regarding energy networks , and of what has been stressed in greater detail by mr olssen , mrs hautala and mr burenstam .
the interest expressed by the members present here who are particularly close to the baltic region , in particular those of sweden and denmark , show that the region is not forgotten by the union .
cooperation in the regions is developing speedily and the commission feels that it has a contribution to make there , and is so doing .
to promote the objectives of the baltic states the presidency , currently sweden , has invited the prime ministers to an extraordinary summit in visby .
the aim of this meeting , as we understand it , mr president , is to have an optimal direct dialogue between prime ministers , to promote mutual understanding and define mutual objectives .
these documents give an overview of the region 's potential , of cooperation activities and of the financial instruments .
the initiative was presented using the existing financial funds , which are , as far as the commission is concerned , the phare programme , the tacis programme ad the interreg programme .
it is also expected that the international financial institutions , including the european investment bank , will also grant aid .
additional financing is therefore not required in our view .
the commission is convinced that working towards common objectives and implementing coordinated measures will contribute to the desirable stability , prosperity and democratic content of the baltic sea region .
the baltic region is a region with many opportunities and great potential as regards natural resources , production and trade , with a total population of around 60 million .
the baltic region is also a region of considerable importance as regards security policy ; it could play an important role in establishing good relations and closer cooperation between the european union , the former soviet states and russia .
nevertheless , common initiatives and efforts are required from both the baltic states themselves and from the european union if democratic and economic development in the region is to be fostered .
a strategy of this kind is in accordance with the new , expanded concept of security which we must all accept .
an active and effective security policy must above all seek to counter the threats which have their origins in social , economic and ecological problems .
military alliances and investment in military resources can never be the prime method of ensuring security and safety .
i therefore urge the commission to submit practical proposals at the summit on these areas and thereby help make the outcome of the meeting as substantive as possible .
finally , it is important to stress that we should not regard this baltic sea initiative as competing with the mediterranean programme .
there is no conflict between these two areas of regional cooperation in europe .
both are equally important for the achievement of harmonious and peaceful development in europe .
mr president , at the beginning of may the heirs to the hanseatic league will be holding a summit meeting in visby at which the discussion will include promoting the development of the area 's economy .
for this meeting the commission has drawn up its cooperation initiative for the baltic sea area , through which it will attempt to support the area 's development in a wide variety of ways .
in the field of economic cooperation the measures the commission is prepared to support through the phare programme include a free trade area comprising estonia , latvia and lithuania and the foundation of a customs union by 1998 .
by means of the same programme the commission undertakes to promote the achievement of free trade in the framework of the central european free trade agreement between the baltic states and poland .
the commission quite rightly draws attention to the important role of small and medium-sized undertakings in promoting trade cooperation .
in order to improve their trading conditions the commission is cooperating with the international financial institutions with a view , inter alia , to founding a baltic business council .
the commission also considers it important to link the union 's electricity and gas networks to the corresponding networks in the associated countries , such as the baltic electricity network .
these priorities are excellent , but it is surprising that the project list does not make any mention of the nordic countries ' gas network linking the russian and norwegian gas resources .
this gas network permits a good level of security of supply which will benefit not only the baltic region but the whole of europe .
it is to be hoped that the visby summit will extend the gas network list in this sense .
mr president , i should like to put forward two points which i think are important .
first of all the council and commission must remember that the barents sea area is a vital part of the baltic region .
the barents euro-arctic council must be given an equal position with the council of baltic states .
the union must also participate more actively than hitherto in the development of the barents sea area .
secondly , if the plans to deepen and enlarge the eu are achieved , this will give rise to a damaging two-way split in the baltic region in which russia will become isolated .
according to current plans the eu is developing into a tight economic , political and even military union from which only russia will be excluded .
there is thus a serious contradiction between the union 's declared and de facto objectives .
to ensure the favourable development of the baltic region it is necessary to create pan-european cooperation in which russia too has an equal part .
in principle this could be done either by accepting russia too as an eu member state or by turning the council of europe into a strong pan-european cooperation umbrella .
both alternatives would mean in practice that europe would be made up of several cooperation areas which each state would contribute to unifying under its own conditions and at its own speed .
i hope that we can promote a realistic discussion about the future of europe as a whole on the basis of these alternatives .
finally , when we speak of the development of the baltic region , we must remember that this is a part of the eu 's wider northern policy which also includes the arctic regions .
the union is already involved in the work of the barents euroarctic council .
the summit is also important because it brings together members of the council of baltic sea states and two of the three leading institutions of the eu : the council and the commission .
it is regrettable that given the importance of the summit there is not some representation from the european parliament .
four members of the council of baltic sea states are eu members already , while four are applying for membership : estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland .
the eu has a partnership and cooperation agreement with russia . the eu has a direct interest in the matters under discussion at visby .
the eu is already playing a key role in encouraging better regional cooperation between the baltic sea states .
the eu is committed to countering pollution in the baltic sea and ensuring the safety of nuclear plants and installations .
through tacis , phare and interreg the eu is assisting the economic and political reform process in the former soviet bloc .
the eu 's europe and partnership agreements are designed to encourage this further with due respect to the human rights and rights of minorities wherever they live .
controlling the growth of crime and the mafia will be vital as the eu expands .
however , the eu should be careful that it does not stimulate unrealistic expectations amongst the baltic sea states .
eu entry for poland and the baltic states will not happen overnight .
the eu and the applicant states have much to prepare before enlargement can take place .
obvious examples are the reform of the cap and structural funds and reform of the eu 's decision-making structures .
economically , legally and socially , poland , and especially the baltic states still have much ground to make up .
further work needs to be done to guarantee the rights of russian-speaking minorities in estonia and latvia .
realism is necessary today to prevent bitter disappointment and disillusionment tomorrow .
when it comes to security we should make it clear that the extension of nato to all potential future members of the eu is not desirable or feasible .
other security mechanisms must be found : for example , the reformed weu and a revitalized osce .
security cooperation with russia , through nato , also requires further work .
i hope that the summit at visby will take place in a spirit of positive , but realistic cooperation .
i should like to mention by way of a rider that i feel that the house has been treated somewhat with contempt today because this baltic debate has been put back by four hours .
furthermore , i think it is treating the members of this house and the millions of people that they collectively represent with contempt .
i hope it will not reoccur .
mr president , the major change in europe over the past few years has significantly affected the position of the states in the baltic sea area .
finland and sweden have joined the european union following the breakdown of europe 's ideological and military division .
the baltic countries and poland , having regained their independence , have concluded association agreements with the eu with a view to membership .
russia is seeking its way towards democracy and the market economy .
a cooperation and partnership agreement has been negotiated between the eu and russia which should hopefully enter into force this year .
it is important that all the regions in the baltic area should take part in the visby summit and that the european union should have a strong presence there .
hopefully the meeting will mark the beginning of cooperation founded on the participation , equality and mutual respect of all parties .
the main objective of the visby conference will naturally enough be strengthening democratic and economic development in the area . similarly the meeting is expected to send a positive message about eu enlargement .
it is also essential to give further impetus to concrete projects on the environment , transport and energy networks .
on behalf of the finnish social democrats , i should like to place particular stress on the importance of implementing and reconciling the tacis , phare and interreg programmes so that the region will benefit from them in practice .
we also support the inclusion on the list of europe-wide gas networks the one linking russia 's and norway 's gas resources .
in the baltic region there is a need for cooperation based on respect for the independence of all the countries in the areas .
at the same time emphasis must be placed on the protection of the rule of law and minority rights in the states of the region .
the baltic countries and poland have expressed their wish to join not only the european union but also the european security systems .
it needs to be stated plainly that the legitimate security interests of these countries must be taken seriously .
the baltic states must not be left in the lurch .
at the same time , security solutions must be such as to increase the stability of the whole baltic region .
mr president , the speeches of honourable members in the last round have raised one or two points on which i should like to make a few remarks .
mrs theorin and mrs iivari in particular spoke of security and also of security organizations with regard to the baltic .
i should like to point out that the four baltic countries are associate partners of western european union and take part regularly as observers in various sittings of the weu council .
i can also say that at the time the association of these countries with the weu was an italian initiative .
it was during the italian presidency of the weu two or three years ago if i am not mistaken that that initiative was taken and their participation has been standard , active and effective .
i think that should be remembered .
then i would mention that poland , estonia , latvia and lithuania , four baltic countries which are not members of other european organizations , send observers to the weu parliamentary assembly .
strangely enough , the president of the parliamentary assembly of the weu , sir dudley smith , is in rome today and will in fact be holding discussions .
another point : mr v&auml;yrinen referred to the arctic council and the barents sea .
the idea in fact will have to be given some consideration in the future too , in relation also to the application of the law of the sea .
mr v&auml;yrinen and mrs iivari have also spoken of minorities , a matter which we discussed this afternoon in reply to a question from mr ebner .
we may therefore refer to what was said particularly as regards the european countries which are members of the union .
here i should like to mention , in case it may be of interest , both the council of europe convention on protection of minorities and the central european initiative ince in this same connection .
i have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken at noon tomorrow .
commission statement on bse
the next item is the statement by the commission on bse , including the financial aspects .
since then , some three weeks have passed , and today i should like to bring the house up to date on a number of important events which have taken place , and make some comments for the future .
however , let me first of all say a few words of explanation concerning the remarks i made at the weekend about british beef .
the commission has never said that british beef is unsafe .
the first doubts over the safety of british beef arose as a result of the statement made by the british government in the british house of commons .
this was based on article 43 of the ec treaty , which the court of justice has interpreted as extending to health issues , where these are connected with agriculture .
and i cannot see any reason why i should behave differently from a british farmer , for example , or a british worker .
so i entirely fail to understand why i should be criticized on precisely these grounds by the british national farmers ' union - unless perhaps it is part of some strategy for restoring consumer confidence ?
and in any event , my comments make no difference whatever to the fact that the commission was entirely within its rights in deciding to prohibit for the time being all exports of british beef and beef products .
our intention was , and still is , to eliminate any possible risk for the consumer .
but let us return to my starting-point .
the committee took the view that these measures were important , in that they reduced the risk of coming into contact with the infective agent which causes bse .
however , it added that this threat should be further reduced by removing from the food chain all those animals which had had any probable contact with the agent .
fifthly , the veterinary services in the united kingdom will step up their inspections to ensure that controls on the identification and destruction of cattle are in fact being scrupulously carried out .
within the next few weeks , the commission will send an inspection team to the united kingdom , including experts from the other member states .
this team will have the task of checking on the implementation of the measures which have already been adopted .
on 9 april , the veterinary standing committee again reviewed the whole body of scientific knowledge on rendering the infective agent inactive in the course of tallow and gelatine production .
on 2 and 3 april , prior to these discussions , the world health organization held a hearing of experts on public health issues connected with communicable spongiform encephalopathies in humans and animals .
besides issuing a number of other recommendations , the who experts took the view that gelatine and tallow are quite safe , provided certain processing methods are applied .
i can also inform the house that on 15 april , the standing committee on foodstuffs , chaired by my colleague mr bangemann , dealt with the issue of the use of gelatine and similar products .
in addition , the scientific committee of the european medicines evaluation agency met in london on 15 and 16 april .
the committee made it clear in its recommendations that in the manufacture of gelatine for medicinal purposes , raw materials should be used that were not of british origin .
as regards the use of tallow and other substances made from cattle , it was established that in the pharmaceutical sector , special manufacturing processes are applied which ensure that the agent causing bse is rendered inactive .
however , we are not only concerned with health and veterinary measures ; as you know , we also have a tremendous marketing problem to solve .
since the bse crisis came to a head , the marketing of beef products throughout the community has become a very serious problem .
